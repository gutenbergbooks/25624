      <p class="boldleft"><a name="1"></a>CHAPTER I.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">&quot;FRED&quot; BURNABY</p>
      <p class="main">I made the acquaintance of Colonel Fred Burnaby in a balloon.
        In such<br>
        strange quarters, at an altitude of over a thousand feet, commenced a<br>
        friendship that for years was one of the pleasantest parts of my life,<br>
        and remains one of its most cherished memories.</p>
      <p class="main">It was on the 14th of September, 1874. A few weeks earlier
        two French<br>
        aeronauts, a Monsieur and Madame Duruof, making an ascent from Calais,<br>
        had been carried out to sea, and dropping into the Channel, had passed<br>
        through enough perils to make them a nine days' wonder. Arrangements had<br>
        been completed for them to make a fresh ascent from the grounds of the<br>
        Crystal Palace, and half London seemed to have gone down to Sydenham to<br>
        see them off. I was young and eager then, and having but lately joined<br>
        the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily News </span>as special correspondent,
        was burning for<br>
        an opportunity to distinguish myself. So I went off to the Crystal<br>
        Palace resolved to go up in the balloon.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Coxwell, when I asked him if there
        were a seat to spare<br>
        in the car. &quot;No; I am sorry to say that you are too late. I have
        had at<br>
        least thirty applications for seats, and as the car will hold only six<br>
        persons, and as practically there are but two seats for outsiders, you<br>
        will see that it is impossible.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This was disappointing, the more so as I had brought with
        me a large<br>
        military cloak and a pair of seal-skin gloves, under a general but<br>
        well-defined impression that the thing to do up in a balloon was to keep<br>
        yourself warm. Mr. Coxwell's account of the position of affairs so<br>
        completely shut out the prospect of a passage in the car that I<br>
        reluctantly resigned the charge of the military cloak and gloves, and<br>
        strolled down to the enclosure where the process of inflating the<br>
        balloon was going on. Here was congregated a vast crowd, which increased<br>
        in density as four o'clock rang out, and the great mass of brown silk<br>
        into which the gas was being assiduously pumped began to assume a<br>
        pear-like shape, and sway to and fro in the light air of the autumn<br>
        afternoon.</p>
      <p class="main">About this time the heroes of the hour, Monsieur and Madame
        Duruof<br>
        walked into the enclosure, accompanied by Mr. Coxwell and Mr. Glaisher.<br>
        A little work was being extensively sold in the Palace bearing on the<br>
        title-page, over the name &quot;M. Duruof,&quot; a murderous-looking face,
        the<br>
        letter-press purporting to be a record of the life and adventures of<br>
        the French aeronauts. Happily M. Duruof bore but the slightest<br>
        resemblance to this portrait, being a young man of pleasing appearance,<br>
        with a good, firm, frank-looking face.</p>
      <p class="main">By a quarter to five o'clock the monster balloon was almost
        fully<br>
        charged, and was swaying to and fro in a wild, fitful manner, that could<br>
        not have been beheld without trepidation by any of the thirty gentlemen<br>
        who had so judiciously booked seats in advance. The wickerwork car now<br>
        secured to the balloon was half filled with ballast and crowded with<br>
        men, whilst others hung on to the ropes and to each other in the effort<br>
        to steady it.</p>
      <p class="main">But they could not do much more than keep it from mounting
        into mid-air.<br>
        Hither and thither it swung, parting in swift haste the curious throng<br>
        that encompassed it, and dragging the men about as if they were ounce<br>
        weights. The wind seemed to be rising and the faces of the experienced<br>
        aeronauts grew graver and graver, answers to the constantly repeated<br>
        question, &quot;Where is it likely to come down?&quot; becoming increasingly<br>
        vague. At last Mr. Glaisher, looking up at the sky and round at the<br>
        neighbouring trees bending under the growing blast, put his veto upon<br>
        Madame Duruof's forming one of the party of voyagers.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;We are not in France,&quot; he said. &quot;The people
        will not insist upon a<br>
        woman going up when there is any danger. The descent is sure to be<br>
        rough, will possibly be perilous, so Madame Duruof had better stay where<br>
        she is.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Madame Duruof was ready to go, but was at least equally
        willing to stay<br>
        behind, and so it was settled that she should not leave the palace<br>
        grounds by the balloon. I cast a lingering thought on the military cloak<br>
        and the seal-skin gloves, in safe keeping in a remote part of the<br>
        building. If Madame was not going there might be room for a substitute.<br>
        But again Mr. Coxwell would not listen to the proposal. There were at<br>
        least thirty prior applicants; some had even paid their money, and they<br>
        must have the preference.</p>
      <p class="main">At five o'clock all was ready for the start. M. Wilfrid
        de Fonvielle,<br>
        a French aeronaut and journalist, took off his hat, and in full gaze of<br>
        a sympathising and deeply interested crowd deliberately attired himself<br>
        in a Glengarry cap, a thick overcoat, and a muffler. M Duruof put on<br>
        his overcoat, and Mr. Barker, Mr. Coxwell's assistant, seated on the<br>
        ring above the car, began to take in light cargo in the shape of<br>
        aneroids, barometers, bottles of brandy and water, and other useful<br>
        articles. M. Duruof scrambled into the car, one of the men who had been<br>
        weighing it down getting out to make room for him. Then M. de Fonvielle,<br>
        amid murmurs of admiration from the crowd, nimbly boarded the little<br>
        ship, and immediately began taking observations. There was a pause, and<br>
        Mr. Coxwell, who stood by the car, prepared for the rush of the Thirty.<br>
        But nobody volunteered. Names were called aloud; only the wind, sighing<br>
        amongst the trees made answer.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Il faut partir,&quot; said M. Duruof, somewhat impatiently.
        Then a<br>
        middle-aged gentleman, who, I afterwards learned, had come all the way<br>
        from Cambridge to make the journey, and who had only just arrived<br>
        breathless on the ground, was half-lifted, half-tumbled in, amid<br>
        agonised entreaties from Barker to &quot;mind them bottles.&quot; The
        Thirty had<br>
        unquestionably had a fair chance, and Mr. Coxwell made no objection as
        I<br>
        passed him and got into the car, followed by one other gentleman, who<br>
        brought the number up to the stipulated half-dozen. We were all ready
        to<br>
        start, but it was thought desirable that Madame Duruof should show<br>
        herself in the car. So she was lifted in, and the balloon allowed to<br>
        mount some twenty feet, frantically held by ropes by the crowd below.
        It<br>
        descended again, Madame Duruof got out, and in her place came tumbling<br>
        in a splendid fellow, some six feet four high, broad-chested to boot,<br>
        who instantly made supererogatory the presence of half a dozen of the<br>
        bags of ballast that lay in the bottom of the car.</p>
      <p class="main">It was an anxious moment, with the excited multitude spread
        round far as<br>
        the eye could reach, the car leaping under the swaying balloon, and the<br>
        anxious, hurried men straining at the ropes. But I remember quite well<br>
        sitting at the bottom of the car and wondering when the new-comer would<br>
        finish getting in. I dare say he was nimble enough, but his full arrival<br>
        seemed like the paying out of a ship's cable.</p>
      <p class="main">This was Fred Burnaby, only Captain then, unknown to fame,
        with Khiva<br>
        unapproached, and the wilds of Asia Minor untrodden by his horse's<br>
        hoofs. His presence on the grounds was accidental, and his undertaking<br>
        of the journey characteristic. He had invited some friends to dine<br>
        with him that night at his rooms, then in St. James's Street. Hearing<br>
        of the proposed balloon ascent, he felt drawn to see the voyagers off,<br>
        purposing to be home in time to dress for dinner. The defection of the<br>
        Thirty appearing to leave an opening for an extra passenger, Burnaby<br>
        could not resist the temptation. So with a hasty <span class="italic">Au
        revoir!</span> to his<br>
        companion, the Turkish Minister, he pushed his way through the crowd<br>
        and dropped into the car.</p>
      <p class="main">I always forgot to ask him how his guests fared. As it turned
        out, he<br>
        had no chance of communicating with his servant before the dinner hour.<br>
        The arrival of Burnaby exceeded by one the stipulated number of<br>
        passengers, and Coxwell was anxious for us to start before any more got<br>
        in. For a minute or two we still cling to the earth, the centre of an<br>
        excited throng that shout, and tug at ropes, and run to and fro, and<br>
        laugh, and cry, and scream &quot;Good-bye&quot; in a manner that makes
        our<br>
        proposed journey seem dreadful in prospect. The circle of faces look<br>
        fixedly into ours; we hear the voices of the crowd, see the women<br>
        laughing and crying by turns, and then, with a motion that is absolutely<br>
        imperceptible, they all pass away, and we are in mid-air where the echo<br>
        of a cheer alone breaks the solemn calm.</p>
      <p class="main">I had an idea that we should go up with a rush, and be instantly
        in the<br>
        cold current of air in view of which the preparation of extra raiment,<br>
        the nature of which has been already indicated, had been made. But here<br>
        we were a thousand feet above the level of the Palace gardens, sailing<br>
        calmly along in bright warm sunlight, and no more motion perceptible<br>
        than if we were sitting on chairs in the gardens, and had been so<br>
        sitting whilst the balloon mounted. It was a quarter past five when we<br>
        left the earth, and in less than five minutes the Crystal Palace<br>
        grounds, with its sea of upturned faces, had faded from our sight.<br>
        Contrary to prognostication, there was only the slightest breeze, and<br>
        this setting north-east, carried us towards the river in the direction<br>
        of Greenwich. We seemed to skirt the eastern fringe of London, St.<br>
        Paul's standing out in bold relief through the light wreath of mist that<br>
        enveloped the city. The balloon slowly rose till the aneroid marked a<br>
        height of fifteen hundred feet. Here it found a current which drove it<br>
        slightly to the south, till it hovered for some moments directly over<br>
        Greenwich Hospital, the training ship beneath looking like a cockle boat<br>
        with walking sticks for masts and yards. Driving eastward for some<br>
        moments, we slowly turned by Woolwich and crossed the river thereafter<br>
        steadily pursuing a north-easterly direction.</p>
      <p class="main">Looking back from the Essex side of the river the sight
        presented to<br>
        view was a magnificent one. London had vanished, even to the dome of<br>
        St. Paul's, but we knew where the great city lay by the mist that<br>
        shrouded it and shone white in the rays of the sun. Save for this patch<br>
        of mist, that seemed to drift after us far away below the car, there was<br>
        nothing to obscure the range of vision. I am afraid to say how many<br>
        miles it was computed lay within the framework of the glowing panorama.<br>
        But I know that we could follow the windings of the river that curled<br>
        like a dragon among the green fields, its shining scales all aglow in<br>
        the sunlight, and could see where it finally broadened out and trended<br>
        northward. And there, as M. Duruof observed with a significant smile,<br>
        was &quot;the open sea.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">There was no feeling of dizziness in looking down from the
        immense<br>
        height at which we now floated--two thousand feet was the record as<br>
        we cleared the river. By an unfortunate oversight we had no map of<br>
        the country, and were, except in respect of such landmarks as<br>
        Greenwich, unable with certainty to distinguish the places over which<br>
        we passed.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;That,&quot; said Burnaby from his perch up in the
        netting over the car,<br>
        where he had clambered as being the most dangerous place immediately<br>
        accessible, &quot;is one of the great drawbacks to the use of balloons
        in<br>
        warfare. Unless a man has natural aptitude, and is specially trained<br>
        for the work, his observations from a balloon are of no use, a<br>
        bird's-eye view of a country giving impressions so different from the<br>
        actual position of places.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This dictum was illustrated by the scene spread out beneath
        us. Seen<br>
        from a balloon the streets of a rambling town resolve themselves into<br>
        beautifully defined curves, straight lines, and various other highly<br>
        respectable geometrical shapes.</p>
      <p class="main">We could not at any time make out forms of people. The white
        highways<br>
        that ran like threads among the fields, and the tiny openings in the<br>
        towns and villages which we guessed were streets, seemed to belong to<br>
        a dead world, for nowhere was there trace of a living person. The<br>
        strange stillness that brooded over the earth was made more uncanny<br>
        still by cries that occasionally seemed to float in the air around us,<br>
        behind, before, to the right, to the left, but never exactly beneath<br>
        the car. We could hear people calling, and had a vague idea they were<br>
        running after us and cheering; but we could distinguish no moving<br>
        thing. Yes; once the gentleman from Cambridge exclaimed that there<br>
        were some pheasants running across a field below; but upon close<br>
        investigation they turned out to be a troop of horses capering about<br>
        in wild dismay. A flock of sheep in another field, huddled close<br>
        together, looked like a heap of limestone chippings. As for the<br>
        fields stretched out in wide expanse, far as the eye could reach,<br>
        they seemed to form a gigantic carpet, with patterns chiefly diamond<br>
        shape, in colour shaded from bright emerald to russet brown.</p>
      <p class="main">At six o'clock the sun began to drop behind a broad belt
        of black<br>
        cloud that had settled over London. The mist following us ever since<br>
        we crossed the river had overtaken us, even passed us, and was<br>
        strewed out over the earth, the sky above our heads being yet a<br>
        beautiful pale blue. We were passing with increased rapidity over the<br>
        rich level land that stretches from the river bank to Chelmsford, and<br>
        there was time to look round at each other. Burnaby had come down from<br>
        the netting and disposed his vast person amongst us and the bags of<br>
        ballast. He was driven down by the smell of gas, which threatened to<br>
        suffocate us all when we started. M. Wilfrid de Fonvielle, kneeling<br>
        down by the side of the car, was perpetually &quot;taking observations,&quot;<br>
        and persistently asking for &quot;the readings,&quot; which the gentleman
        from<br>
        Cambridge occasionally protested his inability to supply, owing either<br>
        to Burnaby having his foot upon the aneroid, or to the Captain so<br>
        jamming him up against the side of the car that the accurate reading<br>
        of a scientific instrument was not only inconvenient but impossible.</p>
      <p class="main">When we began to chat and exchange confidences, the fascination
        which<br>
        balloon voyaging has for some people was testified to in a striking<br>
        manner. The gentleman from Cambridge had a mildness of manner about him<br>
        that made it difficult to conceive him engaged in any perilous<br>
        enterprise. Yet he had been in half a dozen balloon ascents, and had<br>
        posted up from his native town on hearing that a balloon was going up<br>
        from the Crystal Palace. As for Burnaby, it was borne in upon me, even<br>
        at this casual meeting, that it did not matter to him what enterprise<br>
        he embarked upon, so that it were spiced with danger and promised<br>
        adventure. He had some slight preference for ballooning, this being his<br>
        sixteenth ascent, including the time when the balloon burst, and the<br>
        occupants of the car came rattling down from a height of three thousand<br>
        feet, and were saved only by the fortuitous draping of the half emptied<br>
        balloon, which prevented all the gas from escaping.</p>
      <p class="main">At half-past six we were still passing over the Turkey carpet,<br>
        apparently of the same interminable pattern. Some miles ahead the level<br>
        stretch was broken by clumps of trees, which presently developed into<br>
        woods of considerable extent. It was growing dusk, and no town or<br>
        railway station was near. Burnaby, assured of being too late for his<br>
        dinner party, wanted to prolong the journey. But the farther the balloon<br>
        went the longer would be the distance over which it would have to be<br>
        brought back and Mr. Coxwell's assistant was commendably careful of his<br>
        employer's purse. On approaching Highwood the balloon passed over a<br>
        dense wood, in which there was some idea of descending. But finally the<br>
        open ground was preferred, and, the wood being left behind, a ploughed<br>
        field was selected as the place to drop, and the gas was allowed to<br>
        escape by wholesale. The balloon swooped downward at a somewhat<br>
        alarming pace, and if Barker had had all his wits about him he would<br>
        have thrown out half a bag of ballast and lightened the fall. But after<br>
        giving instructions for all to stoop down in the bottom of the car and<br>
        hold onto the ropes, he himself promptly illustrated the action, and<br>
        down we went like a hawk towards the ground.</p>
      <p class="main">As it will appear even to those who have never been in a
        balloon, no<br>
        advice could have been worse than that of stooping down in the bottom
        of<br>
        the car, which was presently to come with a great shock to the earth,<br>
        and would inevitably have seriously injured any who shared its contact.<br>
        Fortunately Burnaby, who was as cool as if he were riding in his<br>
        brougham, shouted out to all to lift their feet from contact with the<br>
        bottom of the car, and to hang on to the ropes. This was done, and when<br>
        the car struck the earth it merely shook us, and no one had even a<br>
        bruise.</p>
      <p class="main">Before we began to descend at full speed the grappling iron
        had been<br>
        pitched over, and, fortunately, got a firm hold in a ridge of the<br>
        ploughed land. Thus, when the balloon, after striking the ground, leapt<br>
        up again into the air and showed a disposition to wander off and tear<br>
        itself to pieces against the hedges and trees, it was checked by the<br>
        anchor rope and came down again with another bump on the ground. This<br>
        time the shock was not serious, and after a few more flutterings it<br>
        finally stood at ease.</p>
      <p class="main">The highest altitude reached by the balloon was three thousand
        feet, and<br>
        this was registered about a couple of miles before we struck Highwood.<br>
        For some distance before completing this descent we had been skimming<br>
        along at about a thousand feet above the level of the fields, and the<br>
        intention to drop being evident, a great crowd of rustics gallantly kept<br>
        pace with the balloon for the last half-mile. By the time we were fairly<br>
        settled down, half a hundred men, women, and children had converged upon<br>
        the field from all directions, and were swarming in through the hedge.</p>
      <p class="main">Actually the first in at the death was an old lady attired
        chiefly in a<br>
        brilliant orange-coloured shawl, who came along over the ridges with a<br>
        splendid stride. But she did not fully enjoy the privilege she had so<br>
        gallantly earned. She was making straight for the balloon, when Burnaby<br>
        mischievously warned her to look out, for it might &quot;go off.&quot;
        Thereupon<br>
        the old lady, without uttering a word in reply, turned round and, with<br>
        strides slightly increased in length, made for the hedge, through which<br>
        she disappeared, and the orange-coloured shawl was seen no more.</p>
      <p class="main">All the rustics appeared to be in a state more or less dazed.
        What with<br>
        having been running some distance, and what with surprise at discovering<br>
        seven gentlemen dropped out of the sky into the middle of a ploughed<br>
        field, they could find relief only in standing at a safe distance with<br>
        their mouths wide open. In vain Barker talked to them in good broad<br>
        English, and begged them to come and hold the car whilst we got out.<br>
        No one answered a word, and none stirred a step, except when the balloon<br>
        gave a lurch, and then they got ready for a start towards the protecting<br>
        hedges. At last Burnaby volunteered to drop out. This he did, deftly<br>
        holding on to the car, and by degrees the intelligent bystanders<br>
        approached and cautiously lent a hand. Finding that the balloon neither<br>
        bit nor burned them, they swung on with hearty goodwill, and so we all<br>
        got out, and Barker commenced the operation of packing up, in which<br>
        task the natives, incited by the promise of a &quot;good drink,&quot;
        lent<br>
        hearty assistance.</p>
      <p class="main">We had not the remotest idea where we were, and night was
        fast closing<br>
        in. Where was the nearest railway station? Perhaps if we had arrived in<br>
        the neighbourhood in a brake or an omnibus, we might have succeeded in<br>
        getting an answer to this question. As it was, we could get none. One<br>
        intelligent party said, after profound cogitation, that it was &quot;over<br>
        theere,&quot; but as &quot;over theere&quot; presented nothing but a vista
        of<br>
        fields--some ploughed and all divided by high hedges--this was scarcely<br>
        satisfactory. In despair we asked where the high-road was, and this<br>
        being indicated, but still vaguely and after a considerable amount of<br>
        thought, Burnaby and I made for it, and presently succeeded in striking<br>
        it.</p>
      <p class="main">The next thing was to get to a railway station, wherever
        it might be,<br>
        and as the last train for town might leave early, the quicker we arrived<br>
        the better. Looking down the road, Burnaby espied a tumble-down cart<br>
        standing close into the hedge, and strode down to requisition it. The<br>
        cart was full of hampers and boxes, and sitting upon the shaft was an<br>
        elderly gentleman in corduroys intently gazing over the hedge at the<br>
        rapidly collapsing balloon, which still fitfully swayed about like a<br>
        drunken man awaking out of sleep.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Will you drive us to the nearest railway station,
        old gentleman?&quot; said<br>
        Burnaby cheerily.</p>
      <p class="main">The old gentleman withdrew his gaze from the balloon and
        surveyed us,<br>
        a feeble, indecisive smile playing about his wooden features; but he<br>
        made no other answer.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Will you drive us to the nearest railway station?&quot;
        repeated Burnaby.<br>
        &quot;We'll pay you well.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Still no answer came from the old gentleman, who smiled
        more feebly than<br>
        ever, now including me in his intelligent purview. After other and<br>
        diverse attempts to draw him into conversation, including the pulling
        of<br>
        the horse and cart into the middle of the road, and the making of a<br>
        feint to start it off at full gallop, it became painfully clear that the<br>
        old gentleman had, at sight of the balloon, gone clean out of such<br>
        senses as he had ever possessed, and as there was a prospect of losing<br>
        the train if we waited till he came round again, nothing remained but
        to<br>
        help ourselves to the conveyance. So Burnaby got up and disposed of as<br>
        much of himself as was possible in a hamper on the top of the cart. I<br>
        sat on the shaft, and taking the reins out of the old gentleman's<br>
        resistless hand, drove off down the road at quite a respectable pace.</p>
      <p class="main">After we had gone about a mile the old gentleman, who had
        been employing<br>
        his unwonted leisure in staring at us all over, broke into a chuckle.<br>
        We gently encouraged him by laughing in chorus, and after a brief space<br>
        he said,--</p>
      <p class="italic">&quot;I seed ye coming.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">As I had a good deal to do to keep the pony up and going,
        Burnaby<br>
        undertook to follow up this glimmering of returning sense on the part
        of<br>
        the old gentleman, and with much patience and tact he succeeded in<br>
        getting him so far round that we ascertained we were driving in the<br>
        direction of &quot;Blackmore.&quot; Further than this we could not get,
        any<br>
        pressure in the direction of learning whether there was a railway<br>
        station at the town or village, or whatever it might be, being followed<br>
        by alarming symptoms of relapse on the part of the old gentleman.<br>
        However, to get to Blackmore was something, and after half an hour's<br>
        dexterous driving we arrived at the village, of which the inn standing<br>
        back under the shade of three immemorial oak trees appeared to be a fair<br>
        moiety.</p>
      <p class="main">We paid the old gentleman and parted company with him, though
        not<br>
        without a saddening fear that the shock of the balloon coming down<br>
        under his horse's nose, as it were, had permanently affected his brain.<br>
        At Blackmore we found a well-horsed trap, and through woods and long<br>
        country lanes drove to Ingatestone, and as fast as the train could<br>
        travel got back to civilisation.</p>
      <p class="main">This was the beginning of a close and intimate friendship,
        that ended<br>
        only with Burnaby's departure for the Soudan. He often talked to me<br>
        of himself and of his still young life. Educated at Harrow, he thence<br>
        proceeded to Germany, where, under private tuition, he acquired an<br>
        unusually perfect acquaintance with the French, Italian, and German<br>
        languages, and incidentally imbibed a taste for gymnastics. At<br>
        sixteen he, the youngest of one hundred and fifty candidates, passed<br>
        his examination for admission to the army, and at the mature age of<br>
        seventeen found himself a cornet in the Royal Horse Guards. At this<br>
        time his breast seems to have been fired by the noble ambition to<br>
        become the strongest man in the world. How far he succeeded is told<br>
        in well-authenticated traditions that linger round various spots in<br>
        Windsor and London. He threw himself into the pursuit of muscle with<br>
        all the ardour since shown in other directions, and the cup of his<br>
        joy must have been full when a precise examination led to the<br>
        demonstration of the fact that his arm measured round the biceps<br>
        exactly seventeen inches. He could put 'Nathalie' (then starring it<br>
        at the Alhambra) to shame with her puny 56-lb. weight in each hand,<br>
        and could 'turn the arm' of her athletic father as if it had been<br>
        nothing more than a hinge-rusted nut-cracker. His plaything at<br>
        Aldershot was a dumb-bell weighing 170 lbs., which he lifted straight<br>
        out with one hand, and there was a standing bet of &pound;10 that no<br>
        other man in the Camp could perform the same feat. At the rooms of<br>
        the London Fencing Club there is to this day a dumb-bell weighing 120<br>
        lbs., with record of how Fred Burnaby was the only member who could<br>
        lift it above his head.</p>
      <p class="main">There is a story told of early barrack days which he assured
        me was<br>
        quite true. A horsedealer arrived at Windsor with a pair of beautiful<br>
        little ponies he had been commanded to show the Queen. Before<br>
        exhibiting them to her Majesty he took them to the Cavalry Barracks<br>
        for display to the officers of the Guards. Some of these, by way of<br>
        a pleasant surprise, led the ponies upstairs into Burnaby's room,<br>
        where they were much admired. But when the time came to take leave an<br>
        alarming difficulty presented itself. The ponies, though they had<br>
        walked upstairs, could by no means be induced to walk down again. The<br>
        officers were in a fix; the horsedealer was in despair; when young<br>
        Burnaby settled the matter by taking up the ponies, one under each<br>
        arm and, walking downstairs, deposited them in the barrack-yard. The<br>
        Queen heard the story when she saw the ponies, and doubtless felt an<br>
        increased sense of security at Windsor, having this astounding<br>
        testimony to the prowess of her Household Troops.</p>
      <p class="main">Cornet Burnaby was as skilful as he was strong. He was one
        of the best<br>
        amateur boxers of the day, as Tom Paddock, Nat Langham, and Bob Travers<br>
        could testify of their well-earned personal experience. Moreover, he<br>
        fenced as well as he boxed, and the turn of his wrist, which never<br>
        failed to disarm a swordsman, was known in more than one of the capitals<br>
        of Europe. Ten years before he started for Khiva, there was much talk
        at<br>
        the Rag of the wonderful feat of the young Guardsman, who undertook<br>
        for a small wager to hop a quarter of a mile, run a quarter of a mile,<br>
        ride a quarter of a mile, row a quarter of a mile, and walk a quarter
        of<br>
        a mile in a quarter of an hour, and who covered the mile and a quarter<br>
        of distance in ten minutes and twenty seconds.</p>
      <p class="main">Fred Burnaby had, whilst barely out of his teens, realised
        his boyish<br>
        dream, and become the strongest man in the world. But he had also begun<br>
        to pay the penalty of success in the coin of wasted tissues and failing<br>
        health. When a man finds, after anxious and varied experiments, that a<br>
        water-ice is the only form of nourishment his stomach will retain, he
        is<br>
        driven to the conviction that there is something wrong, and that he had<br>
        better see the doctor. The result of the young athlete's visit to the<br>
        doctor was that he mournfully laid down the dumb-bells and the foil,<br>
        eschewed gymnastics, and took to travel.</p>
      <p class="image"><img src="images/fred_burnaby.jpg" alt="Col. Fred Burnaby" width="408" height="536"></p>
      <p class="main">An average man advised to travel for his health's sake would
        probably<br>
        have gone to Switzerland or the South of France, according to the sort<br>
        of climate held to be desirable. Burnaby went to Spain, that being at<br>
        the time the most troubled country in Europe, not without promise of an<br>
        outbreak of war. Here he added Spanish to his already respectable stock<br>
        of languages, and found the benefit of the acquisition in his next<br>
        journey, which was to South America, where he spent four months<br>
        shooting unaccustomed game and recovering from the effects of his<br>
        devotion to gymnastics. Returning to do duty with his regiment, he began<br>
        to learn Russian and Arabic, going at them steadily and vigorously, as<br>
        if they were long stretches of ploughed land to be ridden over. A second<br>
        visit to Spain provided him with the rare gratification of being shut
        up<br>
        in Barcelona during the siege, and sharing all the privations and<br>
        dangers of the garrison. Whilst in Seville during a subsequent journey<br>
        he received a telegram saying that his father was seriously ill. France<br>
        was at the time in the throes of civil war, with the Communists holding<br>
        Paris against the army of Versailles. To reach England any other way<br>
        than vi&acirc; Paris involved a delay of many days, and Burnaby determined
        to<br>
        dare all that was to be done by the Communists. So, carrying a Queen's<br>
        Messenger's bag full of cigars in packets that looked more or less like<br>
        Government despatches, he passed through Paris and safely reached<br>
        Calais.</p>
      <p class="main">A year later he set forth intending to journey to Khiva,
        but on reaching<br>
        Naples was striken with fever, spent four months of his leave in bed,<br>
        and was obliged to postpone the trip. In 1874 he once more went to<br>
        Spain, this time acting as the special correspondent of the Times with<br>
        the Carlists, and his letters form not the least interesting chapter in<br>
        the long story of the miserable war. In the early spring of 1875 he made<br>
        a dash at Central Africa, hoping to find &quot;Chinese Gordon&quot; and
        his<br>
        expedition. He met that gallant officer on the Sobat river, a stream<br>
        which not ten Englishmen have seen, and having stayed in the camp for
        a<br>
        few days, set out homeward, riding on a camel through the Berber desert<br>
        to Korosko, a distance of five hundred miles. After an absence of<br>
        exactly four months he turned up for duty at the Cavalry Barracks,<br>
        Windsor, with as much nonchalance as if he had been for a trip to the<br>
        United States in a Cunard steamer.</p>
      <p class="main">It was whilst on this flight through Central Africa that
        the notion of<br>
        the journey to Khiva came back with irresistible force. It had been done<br>
        by MacGahan, but that plucky journalist had judiciously started in the<br>
        spring. Burnaby resolved to accomplish the enterprise in winter; and<br>
        accordingly, on November 30th, 1875, he started by way of St.<br>
        Petersburg, treating himself, as a foretaste of the joys that awaited<br>
        him on the steppes, to the long lonely ride through Russia in midwinter.<br>
        At Sizeran he left civilisation and railways behind him, and rode on a<br>
        sleigh to Orenburg, a distance of four hundred and eighty miles. At<br>
        Orenburg he engaged a Tartar servant, and another stretch of eight<br>
        hundred miles on a sleigh brought him to Fort No. 1, the outpost of the<br>
        Russian army facing the desert of Central Asia. After this even the<br>
        luxury of sleigh-riding was perforce foregone, and Burnaby set out on<br>
        horseback, with one servant, one guide, and a thermometer that<br>
        registered between 70&deg; and 80&deg; below freezing point, to find Khiva<br>
        across five hundred miles of pathless, trackless, silent snow.</p>
      <p class="main">Two Cossacks riding along this route with despatches had
        just before<br>
        been frozen to death. The Russians, inured to the climate, had never<br>
        been able to take Khiva in the winter months. They had tried once, and<br>
        had lost six hundred camels and two-thirds of their men before they saw<br>
        the enemy. But Fred Burnaby gaily went forth, clothed-on with<br>
        sheepskins. After several days' hard riding and some nights' sleep on<br>
        the snow, he arrived in Khiva, chatted with the Khan, fraternised with<br>
        the Russian officers, kept his eyes wide open, and finally was invited<br>
        to return by a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, who had been<br>
        brought to understand how this strange visitor from the Cavalry Barracks<br>
        at Windsor had fluttered the military authorities at St. Petersburg.</p>
      <p class="main">This adventure might have sufficed an ordinary man for a
        lifetime. But<br>
        in the very next year, whilst his <span class="italic">Ride to Khiva</span>
        remained the most<br>
        popular book in the libraries, he paid a second visit to the Turcomans,<br>
        seeking them now, not on the bleak steppes round Khiva, but in the more<br>
        fertile, though by Europeans untrodden, plains of Asia Minor. He had one<br>
        other cherished project of which he often spoke to me. It was to visit<br>
        Timbuctoo. But whilst brooding over this new journey he fell in love,<br>
        married, settled down to domestic life in Cromwell Gardens, and took to<br>
        politics. It was characteristic of him that, looking about for a seat
        to<br>
        fight, he fixed upon John Bright's at Birmingham, that being at the time<br>
        the Gibraltar of political fortresses.</p>
      <p class="main">The last time I saw Fred Burnaby was in September 1884.
        He was standing<br>
        on his doorstep at Somerby Hall, Leicestershire, speeding his parting<br>
        guests. By his side, holding on with all the might of a chubby hand<br>
        to an extended forefinger, was his little son, a child some five years<br>
        old, whose chief delight it was thus to hang on to his gigantic father<br>
        and toddle about the grounds. We had been staying a week with Burnaby<br>
        in his father's old home, and it had been settled, on the invitation<br>
        of his old friend Henry Doetsch, that we should meet again later in<br>
        the year, and set out for Spain to spend a month at Huelva. A few<br>
        weeks later the trumpet sounded from the Soudan, and like an old<br>
        war-horse that joyously scents the battle from afar, Burnaby gave up<br>
        all his engagements, and fared forth for the Nile.</p>
      <p class="main">At first he was engaged in superintending the moving of
        the troops<br>
        between Tanjour and Magrakeh. This was hard work admirably done. But<br>
        Burnaby was always pining to get to the front. In a private letter<br>
        dated Christmas Eve, 1884, he writes: &quot;I do not expect the last boat<br>
        will pass this cataract before the middle of next month, and then I<br>
        hope to be sent for to the front. It is a responsible post Lord<br>
        Wolseley has given me here, with forty miles of the most difficult<br>
        part of the river, and I am very grateful to him for letting me have<br>
        it. But I must say I shall be better pleased if he sends for me when<br>
        the troops advance upon Khartoum.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The order came in due course, and Burnaby was riding on
        to the relief<br>
        of Gordon when his journey was stopped at Abu-Klea. He was attached to<br>
        the staff of General Stewart, whose little force of six-thousand-odd<br>
        men was suddenly surrounded by a body of fanatical Arabs, nine<br>
        thousand strong. The British troops formed square, inside which the<br>
        mounted officers sat directing the desperate defence, that again and<br>
        again beat back the angry torrent. After some hours' fighting, a<br>
        soldier in the excitement of the moment got outside the line of the<br>
        square, and was engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with a cluster of<br>
        Arabs. Burnaby, seeing his peril, dashed out to the rescue--&quot;with
        a<br>
        smile on his face,&quot; as one who saw him tells me,--and was making<br>
        irresistible way against the odds when an Arab thrust a spear in his<br>
        throat, and he fell off his horse dead. He sleeps now, as he always<br>
        yearned to rest, in a soldier's grave, dug for him by chance on the<br>
        continent whose innermost recesses he had planned some day to explore.</p>
      <p class="main">The date of his death was January 17th, 1885. His grave
        is nameless,<br>
        and its place in the lonely Desert no man knoweth.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="smallquote">&quot;Brave Burnaby down! Wheresoever 'tis spoken<br>
          The news leaves the lips with a wistful regret<br>
          We picture that square in the desert, shocked, broken,<br>
          Yet packed with stout hearts, and impregnable yet<br>
          And there fell, at last, in close m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the fighter<br>
          Who Death had so often affronted before;<br>
          One deemed he'd no dart for his valorous slighter<br>
          Who such a gay heart to the battle-front bore.<br>
          But alas! for the spear thrust that ended a story<br>
          Romantic as Roland's, as Lion-Heart's brief<br>
          Yet crowded with incident, gilded with glory<br>
          And crowned by a laurel that's verdant of leaf.<br>
          A latter-day Paladin, prone to adventure,<br>
          With little enough of the spirit that sways<br>
          The man of the market, the shop, the indenture!<br>
          Yet grief-drops will glitter on Burnaby's bays.<br>
          Fast friend as keen fighter, the strife glow preferring,<br>
          Yet cheery all round with his friends and his foes;<br>
          Content through a life-story short, yet soul-stirring<br>
          And happy, as doubtless he'd deem, in its close.&quot;</p>

      <p class="boldleft"><a name="23"></a>CHAPTER II.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">A NIGHT ON A MOUNTAIN</p>
      <p class="main">There are not many English abroad this morning on the top
        of<br>
        the hill. In fact, unless they had passed the night here it<br>
        would not be easy for them to present themselves, seeing that<br>
        San Salvatore, though a very modest mound, standing as it does<br>
        in the neighbourhood of the Alps, is high enough to lift its<br>
        crest out of the curtain of mist that lies over the lower world.<br>
        Lugano, its lake, and its many small towns--as like each other<br>
        when seen from a distance as if they had been turned out of a<br>
        mould--are understood to lie at some uncertain depth beneath<br>
        the mist. In truth, unless they have wholly disappeared in the<br>
        night, we know that they are there, for we walked up in the<br>
        late afternoon with intent to sleep here.</p>
      <p class="main">The people of Lugano, more especially the hotel-keepers,
        were much<br>
        exercised at this undertaking. Nobody in recent recollection had been<br>
        known to spend the night on San Salvatore, and if the eccentricity<br>
        were permitted and proved enjoyable, no one could say that it might<br>
        not spread, leaving empty beds at Lugano. There was, accordingly,<br>
        much stress laid on possible dangers and certain discomforts.<br>
        Peradventure there was no bed; assuredly it would be hard and damp<br>
        and dirty. There would be nothing to eat, nor even to drink; and<br>
        in short, if ever there was madness characteristic of the English<br>
        abroad, here was the mid March of its season.</p>
      <p class="main">But the undertaking was not nearly so mad as it looked.
        I had been<br>
        up Salvatore on the previous day and surveyed the land. It is a<br>
        place that still holds high rank in the Romish calendar of Church<br>
        celebrations. Many years ago a chapel was built on its summit, and<br>
        pilgrimages instituted. These take place at Ascension and Pentecost,<br>
        when the hillside swarms with devout sons and daughters of Italy, and<br>
        the music of high mass breaks the silence of the mountains. Even<br>
        pilgrims must eat and drink and sleep, and shortly after the chapel<br>
        was built there rose up at its feet, in a sheltered nook, a little<br>
        house, a chapel-of-ease in the sense that here was sold wine of the<br>
        country, cheese of the district, and <span class="italic">jambon</span>
        reputed to come across<br>
        the seas from distant &quot;Yorck.&quot; A spare bedroom was also established<br>
        for the accommodation of the officiating priests, and it was on the<br>
        temporary reversion of this apartment that I had counted in making<br>
        those arrangements that Lugano held to be hopelessly heretical.</p>
      <p class="main">When, on my first visit to the top of San Salvatore, I reached<br>
        the pilgrimage chapel, I found an old gentleman standing at the<br>
        door of the hostelry by which the pilgrim must needs pass on<br>
        his way to the chapel--a probably undesigned but profitable<br>
        arrangement, since it brings directly under his notice the<br>
        possibility of purchasing &quot;vins du pays, pain, fromage,<br>
        saucissons, and jambon d'Yorck.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">When I broached the subject of the night's entertainment
        the<br>
        landlord was a little taken aback, and evidently inclined<br>
        to dwell upon those inconveniences of which Lugano had made<br>
        so much. But the more he thought of it, the more he liked the<br>
        idea. As I subsequently learned, the hope of his youth, the<br>
        sustenance of his manhood, and the dream of his old age was<br>
        to see his little hut develop into a grand hotel, with a porter<br>
        in the hall, an army of waiters bustling about, and himself in<br>
        the receipt of custom. It was a very small beginning that two<br>
        English people should propose to lodge with him for a night.<br>
        Still, it was something, and everything must have a beginning.<br>
        Monte Generoso, among the clouds on the other side of the lake,<br>
        began in that way; and look at it now with its <span class="italic">chambres</span>
        at<br>
        eight francs a day, its <span class="italic">table d'h&ocirc;te</span>
        at five francs, and its<br>
        <span class="italic">bougies</span> dispensed at their weight in silver!</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Si, signor&quot;; he thought it might be done. He
        was sure--nay,<br>
        he was positive.</p>
      <p class="main">As the picture of the hotel of the future glowed in his
        mind he<br>
        became enthusiastic, and proposed that we should view the<br>
        apartments. The bedroom we found sufficiently roomy, with both<br>
        fireplace and one of the two windows bricked up to avoid<br>
        draughts. The mattress of the bed, it is true, was stuffed with<br>
        chopped straw, and was not free from suspicion of harbouring<br>
        rats. But there was a gorgeous counterpane, whose many colours<br>
        would have excited the envy of Joseph's brethren had their<br>
        pilgrimage chanced to lead them in this direction. The floor<br>
        was of cement, and great patches of damp displayed themselves<br>
        on the walls. Over the bed hung a peaceful picture of a chubby<br>
        boy clasping a crook to his breast, and exchanging glances of<br>
        maudlin sentimentality with a sheep that skipped at his side.<br>
        The damp had eaten up one of the legs of mutton, and the sheep<br>
        went on three legs. But nothing could exceed the more than<br>
        human tenderness with which it regarded the chubby boy with the<br>
        crook.</p>
      <p class="main">We soon settled about the bed, and there remained only<br>
        the question of food. On this point also our host displayed<br>
        even an increase of airy confidence. What would signor? There<br>
        were sausage, ham of York, and eggs, the latter capable of<br>
        presentation in divers shapes.</p>
      <p class="main">This, it must be admitted, engendered a feeling of discouragement.<br>
        We had two days earlier tasted the sausage of the country when<br>
        served up in a first-class hotel as garnish to a dish of spinach.<br>
        It is apparently made of pieces of gristle, and when liberated from<br>
        the leather case that enshrines it, crumbles like a piece of old<br>
        wall. Sausage was clearly out of the question, and the ham of York<br>
        does not thrive out of its own country, acquiring a foreign flavour<br>
        of salted sawdust. Eggs are very well in their way, but man cannot<br>
        live on eggs alone.</p>
      <p class="main">Our host was a man full of resources. Why should we not
        bring the<br>
        materials for dinner from Lugano? He would undertake to cook them,<br>
        whatever they might be. This was a happy thought that clenched the<br>
        bargain. We undertook to arrive on the following day, bringing our<br>
        sheaves with us, in the shape of a supply of veal cutlets.</p>
      <p class="main">The ostensible object of spending a night on San Salvatore
        is to see<br>
        the sun set and rise. The mountain is not high, just touching three<br>
        thousand feet, an easy ascent of two hours. But it is a place<br>
        glorious in the early morning and solemn in the quiet evening.<br>
        Below lies the lake of Lugano, its full length visible. Straight<br>
        before you, looking east, is the long arm that stretches to Porlezza,<br>
        with its gentle curves where the mountains stand and cool their feet<br>
        in the blue water. To the west, beyond a cluster of small and<br>
        nameless lakes that lie on the plain, we see the other arm of the<br>
        lake, with Ponte Tresa nestling upon it, and still farther west the<br>
        sun gleams on the waters of Lago Maggiore. Above Porlezza is Monte<br>
        Legnone, and far away on the left glint the snow peaks of the Bernina.<br>
        High in the north, above the red tiles and white walls of the town of<br>
        Lugano are the two peaks of Monte Camoghe, flanked by something that<br>
        seems a dark cloud in the blue sky, but which our host says is the<br>
        ridge of St. Gothard. The sun sets behind the Alps of the Valais<br>
        among which towers the Matterhorn and gleam the everlasting snows of<br>
        Monte Rosa.</p>
      <p class="main">These form the framework of a picture which contains all
        the softness<br>
        and richness of the beauty of a land where the grape and the fig<br>
        grow, and where in these October days roses are in full bloom, and<br>
        heliotropes sweeten every breath of air. Yesterday had opened<br>
        splendidly, the morning sun rising over the fair scene and bringing<br>
        out every point. But as we toiled up the hill this afternoon,<br>
        carrying the cutlets, the sun had capriciously disappeared. The<br>
        mountains were hid in clouds, and the lake, having no blue sky to<br>
        reflect, had turned green with chagrin. There was little hope of<br>
        visible sunset; but there was a prospect of sunrise, and certainty<br>
        of a snug dinner in circumstances to which the novelty of the<br>
        surroundings would lend a strange charm.</p>
      <p class="main">It was rather disappointing on arriving to find that our
        acquaintance<br>
        of yesterday had disappeared. I have reason to believe the excitement<br>
        of our proposed visit had been too much for him, and that he had<br>
        found it desirable to retire to rest in the more prosaic habitation<br>
        of the family down in the town. He had selected as substitute the<br>
        most stalwart and capable of his sons, a man of the mature age of<br>
        thirty-five. This person had the family attribute of readiness of<br>
        resource and perfect confidence. The enthusiasm which had been too<br>
        dangerously excited in the breast of his aged parent had been<br>
        communicated to him. He was ready to go anywhere and cook anything,<br>
        and having as a preliminary arranged a napkin under his arm, went<br>
        bustling about the table disturbing imaginary flies and flicking off<br>
        supposititious crumbs, as he had seen the waiter do in the restaurant<br>
        at the hotel down in the town.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Signor had brought the cutlets? Si, and beautiful
        they were! How<br>
        would signor like to have them done? Thus, or thus, or thus?&quot; in
        a<br>
        variety of ways which, whilst their recital far exceeded my limited<br>
        knowledge of the language, filled me with fullest confidence in<br>
        Giacommetti.</p>
      <p class="main">That was his name, he told me in one of his bursts of confidence;<br>
        and a very pretty name it is, though for brevity's sake it may be<br>
        convenient hereafter to particularise him by the initial letter.</p>
      <p class="main">As I was scarcely in a position to decide among the various<br>
        appetising ways of cooking suggested by G., I said I would leave it<br>
        to him.</p>
      <p class="main">But, then, the signor could not make a dinner of cutlets.
        What else<br>
        would he be so good as to like? Sausage, ham of York, and eggs--eggs<br>
        <span class="italic">&agrave; la coque</span> or presented as omelettes.
        No? Then signor would commence<br>
        with soup? Finally <span class="italic">potage au riz</span> was selected
        out of the<br>
        embarrassment of riches poured at our feet by the enthusiastic G.</p>
      <p class="main">There being yet an hour to dinner, we ascended the few steps
        that<br>
        led to the summit of the hill on which the chapel is perched, a<br>
        marvel to all new-comers by the highway of the Lake. The door was<br>
        open, and we walked in. There was no light burning on the altar,<br>
        nor any water in the stone basin by the door. But there was all<br>
        the apparatus of worship--the gaudy toyshop above the grand altar,<br>
        the tiny side chapels, with their pictures of the dying Saviour,<br>
        and the confessional box, now thick with dust, and echoless of<br>
        sob of penitent or counsel of confessor. It was evidently a poorly<br>
        endowed chapel, the tinsel adornments being of the cheapest and<br>
        the candles of the thinnest. But in some past generation a good<br>
        Catholic had bestowed upon it an altarcloth of richest silk,<br>
        daintily embroidered. The colours had faded out of the flowers,<br>
        and the golden hue of the cloth had been grievously dimmed. Still<br>
        it remained the one rich genuine piece of workmanship in a chapel<br>
        disfigured by an overbearing hankering after paper flowers and<br>
        tinsel.</p>
      <p class="main">Early the next morning, whilst reposing under the magnificent<br>
        counterpane on the bed of chopped straw, I was awakened by hearing<br>
        the chapel bell ring for mass. I thought it must be the ghost of<br>
        some disembodied priest, who had come up through the darkness of<br>
        the night and the scarcely more luminous mist of the morning to<br>
        say a mass for his own disturbed soul. But, as I presently learned,<br>
        they were human hands that pulled the bell-rope, and a living<br>
        priest said mass all by himself in this lonely chapel whilst dawn<br>
        was breaking over a sleeping world.</p>
      <p class="main">I saw him some hours later sitting on the kitchen dresser,
        in the<br>
        sanctum where G. worked the mysteries of his art. He was resting<br>
        his elbows on his knees as he leaned forward, and had in his mouth<br>
        a large pipe, from which he vigorously puffed. I found him a very<br>
        cheerful old gentleman, by no means unduly oppressed with the<br>
        solemnity of this early mass in the lonely chapel. He lived down<br>
        at Barbeng, at the back of the hill, and had come up this morning<br>
        purely as a matter of business, and in partial fulfilment of a<br>
        contract entered into with one of his parishioners, whose husband<br>
        had been lost at sea whilst yet they were only twelve months<br>
        married. The widow had scraped together sufficient money to have<br>
        a due number of masses said on San Salvatore for the repose of the<br>
        soul of her young husband. So once a week, whilst the contract ran,<br>
        the old priest made his way up through the morning mist, tolled the<br>
        bell, said the mass, and thereafter comforted himself with a<br>
        voluminous pipe seated on the dresser in G.'s kitchen.</p>
      <p class="main">This is a digression, and I confess I have rather lingered
        over it,<br>
        as it kept the soup waiting.</p>
      <p class="main">The preparation was brought in in a neat white bowl gracefully<br>
        carried aloft by G., who still insisted upon going about with a<br>
        napkin under his arm. Everything was in order except the soup. I<br>
        like to think that the failure may have been entirely due to myself.<br>
        G. had proposed quite a dozen soups, and I had ignorantly chosen<br>
        the only one he could not make. The liquid was brown and greasy,<br>
        smelling horribly of a something which in recognition of G.'s good<br>
        intention I will call butter. The rice, which formed a principal<br>
        component part, presented itself in conglomerate masses, as if G.,<br>
        before placing it in the tureen, had squeezed portions of it in his<br>
        hand.</p>
      <p class="main">Perhaps he had, for he was not in the humour to spare himself
        trouble<br>
        in his effort to make the banquet a success.</p>
      <p class="main">We helped ourselves plentifully to the contents of the tureen,
        which<br>
        was much easier to do than to settle the disposition of the soup. G.<br>
        was in an ecstasy of delight at things having gone on so well thus<br>
        far. He positively pervaded the place, nervously changing the napkin<br>
        from arm to arm, and frantically flicking off imaginary crumbs. At<br>
        length it happily occurred to him that it would be well to go and<br>
        see after the cutlets. Whereupon we emptied the soup back into the<br>
        tureen, and when G. returned were discovered wiping our lips with<br>
        the air of people who had already dined.</p>
      <p class="main">After all, there were the cutlets, and G. had not indulged
        in<br>
        exaggerated approval of their excellence when in a state of nature.<br>
        They were those dainty cuts into which veal naturally seems to<br>
        resolve itself in butcher's shops on the Continent. We observed<br>
        with concern that they looked a little burned in places when they<br>
        came to the table, and the same attraction of variety was maintained<br>
        in the disposition of salt. There were large districts in the area<br>
        of the cutlet absolutely free from savouring. But then you came upon<br>
        a small portion where the salt lay in drifts, and thus the average<br>
        was preserved. We were very hungry and ate the cutlets, which, with<br>
        an allowance of bread, made up the dinner. There were some potatoes,<br>
        fried with great skill, amid much of the compound we had agreed to<br>
        call butter. But, as I explained to G. in reply to a deprecatory<br>
        gesture when he took away the floating mass untouched, I have not<br>
        for more than three years been able to eat a potato. One of my<br>
        relations was, about that date, choked by a piece of potato, and<br>
        since then I have never touched them, especially when fried in a<br>
        great deal of butter.</p>
      <p class="main">We had some cheese, for which Earl Granville's family motto
        would<br>
        serve as literal description. You might bend it, but could not<br>
        break it. I never was partial to bent cheese, but we made a fair<br>
        appearance with this part of the feast, owing to the arrival of<br>
        G.'s dog, a miserable-looking cur, attracted to the banquet-hall<br>
        by unwonted savours. He seemed to like the cheese; and G., when he<br>
        came in with the coffee, was more than ever pleased with our<br>
        appreciation of the good things provided for us.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Rosbif and chiss--ha!&quot; he said, breaking forth
        into English, and<br>
        smiling knowingly upon us.</p>
      <p class="main">He felt he had probed the profoundest depths of the Englishman's<br>
        gastronomical weakness.</p>
      <p class="main">With the appearance of the coffee the real pleasure of the
        evening<br>
        commenced. Along nearly the whole of one side of the banquet-hall<br>
        ran a fireplace, a recess of the proportions of a spare bedroom in<br>
        an ordinary English house. There were no &quot;dogs&quot; or other contrivance<br>
        for minimising the spontaneity of a fire. There are granite quarries<br>
        near, and these had contributed an enormous block which formed a<br>
        hearth raised about six inches above the level of the floor. On this<br>
        an armful of brushwood was placed; and the match applied, it began<br>
        to burn with cheerful crackling laughter and pleasant flame,<br>
        filling the room with a fragrant perfume. For all other light a<br>
        feeble oil lamp twinkled high up on the wall, and a candle burned<br>
        on the table where we had so luxuriantly dined.</p>
      <p class="main">The fitful light shone on the oil paintings which partly
        hid the<br>
        damp on the walls. There was a picture (not a bad one) of St.<br>
        Sebastian pierced with arrows, and in his death-agony turning<br>
        heavenward a beautiful face. There was the portrait of another<br>
        monk holding on to a ladder, each rung of which was labelled with<br>
        a cardinal virtue. There was a crucifixion or two, and what<br>
        elsewhere might well pass for a family portrait--an elderly lady,<br>
        with a cap of the period, nursing a spaniel. The damp had spared<br>
        the spaniel whilst it made grave ravages upon the lady, eating<br>
        a portion of her cheek and the whole of her left ear.</p>
      <p class="main">G. having the dinner off his mind, and having, as was gathered<br>
        from a fearsome clattering in the back premises, washed up the<br>
        dishes, wandered about the shadows in the background and showed<br>
        a disposition for conversation. It was now he unfolded that dream<br>
        of the hotel some day to be built up here, with the porter in the<br>
        hall, the waiters buzzing round, the old man, his father, in the<br>
        receipt of custom, and he (G.) exercising his great natural talents<br>
        in supervising the making of soup, the frying of potatoes, and<br>
        the selection of elastic cheeses. He showed, with pardonable pride,<br>
        a visitors' book in which was written &quot;Leopold, Prince of Great<br>
        Britain and Ireland.&quot; His Royal Highness came here one rainy day<br>
        in 1876, riding on a mule, and escorted by a bedraggled suite.</p>
      <p class="main">Did they partake of any refreshments?</p>
      <p class="main">No; the father, G. frankly admits, lost his head in the
        excitement<br>
        of the moment--a confession which confirms the impression that, on<br>
        a much less auspicious occasion, it has been thought desirable that<br>
        a younger and stronger man should assume the direction of affairs.<br>
        To proffer Royalty <span class="italic">potage au riz</span> on such brief
        notice was of course<br>
        out of the question. But the fatuous old gentleman had permitted a<br>
        Prince of Great Britain and Ireland to descend the mountain without<br>
        having tasted any other of the comestibles which were doubtless on<br>
        hand at the time, and portions of which most probably remain to<br>
        this day.</p>
      <p class="main">About eight o'clock there were indications from the shadowy<br>
        portions of the banqueting chamber that G. was getting sleepy, and<br>
        that the hour had arrived when it was usual for residents to retire<br>
        for the night. Even on the top of a mountain one cannot go to bed<br>
        at eight o'clock, and we affected to disregard these signals.<br>
        Beginning gently, the yawns increased in intensity till they became<br>
        phenomenal. At nine o'clock G. pointedly compared the hour of the<br>
        day as between his watch and mine.</p>
      <p class="main">It was hard to leave a bright wood fire and go to bed at
        nine<br>
        o'clock; but G. was irresistible. He literally yawned us out of<br>
        the room, up the staircase, and into the bed-chamber. There was a<br>
        key hanging by the outside of the door the size of a small club,<br>
        and weighing several pounds. On the inside the keyhole, contrary to<br>
        habitude, was in the centre of the door. From this point of approach<br>
        it was, however, useful rather for ventilation than for any other<br>
        purpose, since the key would not enter. Looking about for some means<br>
        of securing the door against possible intrusions on the part of G.<br>
        with a new soup, I discovered the trunk of a young tree standing<br>
        against the wall. The next discovery was recesses in the wall on<br>
        either side of the door, which suggested the evident purpose of the<br>
        colossal bar. With this across the door one might sleep in peace,<br>
        and I did till eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
      <p class="main">G. had been instructed to call us at sunrise if the morning
        were<br>
        fair. As it happened, our ill luck of the evening was repeated in<br>
        the morning. A thick mist obscured all around us, though as we<br>
        passed down to civilisation and Lugano the sun, growing stronger,<br>
        lifted wreaths of white mist, and showed valley, and lake, and<br>
        town bathed in glorious light.</p>

      <p class="boldleft">CHAPTER III.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">THE PRINCE OF WALES</p>
      <p class="main">We in this country have grown accustomed to the existence
        of the<br>
        Prince of Wales, and his personality, real and fabulous, is not<br>
        unfamiliar on the other side of the Atlantic. But if we come to<br>
        think of it, it is a very strange phenomenon. The only way to<br>
        realise its immensity is to conceive its creation today, supposing<br>
        that heretofore through the history of England there had been<br>
        no such institution. A child is born in accidental circumstances<br>
        and with chance connections that might just as reasonably have<br>
        fallen to the lot of some other entity. He grows from childhood<br>
        through youth into manhood, and all the stages, with increasing<br>
        devotion and deference, he is made the object of reverential<br>
        solicitude. All his wants are provided for, even anticipated. He<br>
        is the first person to be considered wherever he goes. Men who<br>
        have won renown in Parliament, in the camp, in literature, doff<br>
        their hats at his coming, and high-born ladies curtsey.</p>
      <p class="main">It is all very strange; but so is the rising of the sun
        and the<br>
        sequence of the moon. We grow accustomed to everything and take<br>
        the Prince of Wales like the solar system as a matter of course.</p>
      <p class="main">Reflection on the singularity of his position leads to sincere<br>
        admiration of the manner in which the Prince fills it. Take it for<br>
        all in all, there is no post in English public life so difficult<br>
        to fill, not only without reproach, but with success. Day and night<br>
        the Prince lives under the bull's-eye light of the lantern of a<br>
        prying public. He is more talked about, written about, and pulled<br>
        about than any Englishman, except, perhaps, Mr. Gladstone. But Mr.<br>
        Gladstone stands on level ground with his countrymen. If he is<br>
        attacked or misrepresented, he can hit back again. The position of<br>
        the Prince of Wales imposes upon him the impassivity of the target<br>
        used in ordinary rifle practice. Whatever is said or written about<br>
        him, he can make no reply, and the happy result which in the main<br>
        follows upon this necessary attitude suggests that it might with<br>
        advantage be more widely adopted.</p>
      <p class="main">Probably in the dead, unhappy night when the rain was on
        the roof<br>
        and the Tranby Croft scandal was on everybody's tongue, the Prince<br>
        of Wales had some bad quarters of an hour. But whatever he felt or<br>
        suffered, he made no sign. To see him sitting in the chair on the<br>
        bench in court whilst that famous trial was proceeding, no one, not<br>
        having prior knowledge of the fact, would have guessed that he had<br>
        the slightest personal interest in the affair. There was danger of<br>
        his even over-doing the attitude of indifference. But he escaped it,<br>
        and was exactly as smiling, debonair and courtly as if he were in<br>
        his box at the theatre watching the development of some quite other<br>
        dramatic performance. He has all the courage of his race, and his<br>
        long training has steeled his nerves.</p>
      <p class="main">It would be so easy for the Prince of Wales to make mistakes
        that<br>
        would alienate from him the affection which is now his in unstinted<br>
        measure. There are plenty of precedents, and a fatal fulness of<br>
        exemplars. Take, for example, his relations with political life. It<br>
        would not be possible for him now, as a Prince of Wales did at the<br>
        beginning of the century, to form a Parliamentary party, and<br>
        control votes in the House of Commons by cabals hatched at<br>
        Marlborough House. But he might, if he were so disposed, in less<br>
        occult ways meddle in politics. As a matter of fact, noteworthy and<br>
        of highest honour to the Prince, the outside public have not the<br>
        slightest idea to which side of politics his mind is biassed. They<br>
        know all about his private life, what he eats, and how much; how he<br>
        dresses, whom he talks to, what he does from the comparatively<br>
        early hour at which he rises to the decidedly late one at which he<br>
        goes to bed. But in all the gossip daily poured forth about him<br>
        there is never a hint as to whether he prefers the politics of Tory<br>
        or Liberal, the company of Lord Salisbury or Mr. Gladstone.</p>
      <p class="main">In a country where every man in whatever station of life
        is a keen<br>
        politician, this is a great thing to say for one in the position of<br>
        the Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p class="main">This absolute impartiality of attitude does not arise from<br>
        indifference to politics or to the current of political warfare.<br>
        The Prince is a Peer of Parliament, sits as Duke of Cornwall, and<br>
        under that name figures in the division lists on the rare occasions<br>
        when he votes. When any important debate is taking place in the<br>
        House, he is sure to be found in his corner seat on the front Cross<br>
        Bench, an attentive listener. Nor does he confine his attention to<br>
        proceedings in the House of Lords. In the Commons there is no more<br>
        familiar figure than his seated in the Peers' Gallery over the<br>
        clock, with folded hands irreproachably gloved, resting on the<br>
        rail before him as he leans forward and watches with keen interest<br>
        the sometimes tumultuous scene.</p>
      <p class="main">Thus he sat one afternoon in the spring of the session of
        1875. He<br>
        had come down to hear a speech with which his friend, Mr. Chaplin,<br>
        was known to be primed. The House was crowded in every part, a<br>
        number of Peers forming the Prince's suite in the gallery, while<br>
        the lofty figure of Count Munster, German Ambassador, towered at<br>
        his right hand, divided by the partition between the Peers'<br>
        Gallery and that set apart for distinguished strangers. It was a<br>
        great occasion for Mr. Chaplin, who sat below the gangway visibly<br>
        pluming himself and almost audibly purring in anticipation of<br>
        coming triumph. But a few days earlier the eminent orator had the<br>
        misfortune to incur the resentment of Mr. Joseph Gillis Biggar.<br>
        All unknown to him, Joseph Gillis was now lying in wait, and just<br>
        as the Speaker was about to call on the orator of the evening,<br>
        the Member for Cavan rose and observed,--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there are strangers in
        the house.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The House of Commons, tied and bound by its own archaic<br>
        regulations, had no appeal against the whim of the indomitable<br>
        Joey B. He had spied strangers in due form, and out they must go.<br>
        So they filed forth, the Prince of Wales at the head of them, the<br>
        proud English Peers following, and by another exit the Envoy of the<br>
        most potent sovereign of the Continent, representative of a nation<br>
        still flushed with the overthrow of France--all publicly and<br>
        peremptorily expelled at the raising of the finger of an uneducated,<br>
        obscure Irishman, who, when not concerned with the affairs of the<br>
        Imperial Parliament, was curing bacon at Belfast and selling it at<br>
        enhanced prices to the Saxon in the Liverpool market.</p>
      <p class="main">The Prince of Wales bore this unparalleled indignity with
        the good<br>
        humour which is one of his richest endowments. He possesses in rare<br>
        degree the faculty of being amused and interested. The British<br>
        workman, who insists on his day's labour being limited by eight<br>
        hours, would go into armed revolt if he were called upon to toil<br>
        through so long a day as the Prince habitually faces. Some of its<br>
        engagements are terribly boring, but the Prince smiles his way<br>
        through what would kill an ordinary man. His manner is charmingly<br>
        unaffected, and through all the varying duties and circumstances of<br>
        the day he manages to say and do the right thing. It is not a heroic<br>
        life, but it is in its way a useful one, and must be exceedingly hard<br>
        to live.</p>
      <p class="main">Watching the Prince of Wales moving through an assemblage,
        whether<br>
        it be as he enters a public meeting or as he strolls about the<br>
        greensward at Marlborough House on the occasion of a garden party,<br>
        the observer may get some faint idea of the strain ever upon him. You<br>
        can see his eyes glancing rapidly along the line of the crowd in<br>
        search of some one whom he can make happy for the day by a smile or a<br>
        nod of recognition. If there were one there who might expect the<br>
        honour, and who was passed over, the Prince knows full well how sore<br>
        would be the heart-burning.</p>
      <p class="main">There is nothing prettier at the garden party than to see
        him walking<br>
        through the crowd of brave men and fair women with the Queen on his<br>
        arm. Her Majesty used in days gone by to be habile enough at the<br>
        performance of this imperative duty laid upon Royalty of singling<br>
        out persons for recognition. Now, when he is in her company, the<br>
        Prince of Wales does it for her. Escorting her, bare-headed,<br>
        through the throng; he glances swiftly to right or left, and when he<br>
        sees some one whom he thinks the Queen should smile upon he whispers<br>
        the name. The Queen thereupon does her share in contributing to the<br>
        sum of human happiness.</p>
      <p class="main">It is, as I began by saying, all very strange if we look
        calmly at it.<br>
        But, in the present order of things, it has to be done. It is the<br>
        Prince of Wales's daily work, and it is impossible to conceive it<br>
        accomplished with fuller appearance of real pleasure on the part of<br>
        the active agent.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="41"></a>CHAPTER IV.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">A HISTORIC CROWD.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I very much regret that so much of your valuable time
        has been<br>
        absorbed,&quot; said the Lord Chief Justice, speaking to the Tichborne<br>
        Jury, as the massive form of the Claimant vanished through the side<br>
        door, never more to enter the Court of Queen's Bench; &quot;but it will<br>
        be a consolation to you to think that your names will be associated<br>
        in history with the most remarkable trial that has ever occurred in<br>
        the annals of England.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">There was another jury outside Sir Alexander Cockburn's
        immediate<br>
        observation that always struck me, and I saw a good deal of it, as<br>
        not the least notable feature in the great trial that at one time<br>
        engrossed the attention of the English-speaking race. That was the<br>
        crowd that gathered outside the Courts of Justice, then still an<br>
        adjunct of Westminster Hall.</p>
      <p class="main">As there never was before a trial like that of the Claimant,
        so<br>
        there never was a crowd like this. It had followed him through all<br>
        the vicissitudes of his appeal to the jury of his countrymen, and<br>
        of his countrymen's subsequently handing him over to another jury<br>
        upon a fresh appeal. It began to flood the broad spaces at the<br>
        bottom of Parliament Street in far-off days when the case of<br>
        Tichborne <span class="italic">v.</span> Lushington was opened in the
        Sessions House, and it<br>
        continued without weariness or falling-off all through the progress<br>
        of the civil suit, beginning again with freshened zeal with the<br>
        commencement of the criminal trial.</p>
      <p class="main">Like the Severn, Palace Yard filled twice a day whilst the
        blue<br>
        brougham had its daily mission to perform, the crowd assembling in<br>
        the morning to welcome the coming Claimant, and foregathering in<br>
        the evening to speed him on his departure westward. It ranged in<br>
        numbers from 5000 down to 1000. Put the average at 3000, multiply<br>
        it by 291, the aggregate number of days which the Claimant was<br>
        before the Courts in his varied character of plaintiff and<br>
        defendant, and we have 873,000 as the total of the assemblage.</p>
      <p class="main">As a rule, the congregation of Monday was the largest of
        the week.<br>
        Why this should be, students of the manners of this notable crowd<br>
        were not agreed. Some held that the circumstance was to be accounted<br>
        for by the fact that two days had elapsed during which the Claimant<br>
        was not on view, and that on Monday the crowd came back, like a<br>
        giant refreshed, to the feast, which, by regular repetition, had<br>
        partially palled on Friday's appetite. Others found the desired<br>
        explanation in the habit which partly obtains among the labouring<br>
        classes of taking Monday as a second day of rest in the week, and<br>
        of devoting a portion of it to the duty of going down to Westminster<br>
        Hall to cheer &quot;Sir Roger.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Probably both causes united to bring together the greater
        crowd of<br>
        Monday afternoons. It must not be supposed that the mob was composed<br>
        wholly or principally of what are called the working classes. When<br>
        an hon. member rose in the House of Commons, and complained of the<br>
        inconvenience occasioned to legislators by the &quot;Tichborne crowd,&quot;<br>
        another member observed that, relative numbers considered, the House<br>
        of Commons contributed as much to swell the throng as any other<br>
        section of the people. During the last months of the trial, if any<br>
        class predominated it was that which came from the provinces. The<br>
        Claimant was undoubtedly one of the sights of London and before his<br>
        greater attraction the traditional Monument which elsewhere--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="smallquote">&quot;Lifts its tall head and like a bully lies,&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">sank into absolute insignificance. Not to have seen the
        Claimant,<br>
        argued the London of the period unknown. Fashionably dressed ladies<br>
        and exquisitely attired gentlemen battled for front places upon the<br>
        pavement with sturdy agriculturists who had brought their wives and<br>
        daughters to see &quot;Sir Roger,&quot; and who had not the slightest<br>
        intention of going back till they had accomplished their desire.</p>
      <p class="main">It came to pass that there were some two hundred faces in
        the crowd<br>
        familiar to the police as daily attendants at the four o'clock<br>
        festival in Palace Yard. Day after day, they came to feast their<br>
        eyes on the portly figure of &quot;Sir Roger,&quot; and, having gazed
        their<br>
        fill, went away, to return again on the morrow. There was one aged<br>
        gentleman whose grey gaiters, long-tailed coat, and massive umbrella<br>
        were as familiar in Palace Yard as are the features on the clock-face<br>
        in the tower. He came up from somewhere in the country in the days<br>
        when Kenealy commenced his first speech, and, being a hale old man,<br>
        he survived long enough to be in the neighbourhood when the learned<br>
        gentleman had finished his second. At the outset, he was wont to<br>
        fight gallantly for a place of vantage in the ranks near the arch-way<br>
        of the Hall. Then, before the advances of younger and stouter<br>
        newcomers, he faded away into the background. Towards the end, he<br>
        wandered about outside the railings in Bridge Street, and, as the<br>
        clock struck four, got the umbrella as near as its natural<br>
        obstructiveness would permit to the carriage-gate whence the<br>
        Claimant's brougham was presently to issue.</p>
      <p class="main">At first the police authorities dealt with the assembly
        in the<br>
        ordinary manner, a more or less sufficient force being told off for<br>
        the duty of keeping the thoroughfare clear. It soon became manifest<br>
        that the Tichborne crowd, like everything else in connection with<br>
        the trial, required especial treatment, and accordingly a carefully<br>
        elaborated scheme was prepared. Superintendent Denning had under his<br>
        command, for the preservation of peace and order in Palace Yard and<br>
        the adjacent thoroughfares, not less than sixty men. One or two were<br>
        stationed in the justice-chamber itself, and must by the time the<br>
        verdict had been delivered have got pretty well up in the details of<br>
        the case. Others guarded the entrance-door; others lined the passage<br>
        into the yard, others were disposed about the yard itself; whilst,<br>
        after three o'clock, two strong companies stood in reserve in the<br>
        sheds that flank the entrance to the Hall. At half past three the<br>
        crowd began to assemble, building itself up upon the little nucleus<br>
        that had been hanging about all day. The favourite standpoint,<br>
        especially in the cold, uncertain winter weather that marked the<br>
        conclusion of the trial, was inside Westminster Hall, where the<br>
        people were massed on the far side of a temporary barricade which<br>
        the Tichborne case called into being, the railing of which was worn<br>
        black by the touch of the hands of the faithful.</p>
      <p class="main">Outside, in the yard, the crowd momentarily thickened till
        it formed<br>
        a dense lane, opening out from the front of the Hall, and turning to<br>
        the left down to the south carriage-gate. The railings in Bridge<br>
        Street and St. Margaret's Street were banked with people, and ranks<br>
        were formed on the pavement in front of the grass-plot. At a quarter<br>
        to four the policemen under the shed received the word of command,<br>
        and marched out into St. Margaret's Street, some filing off to take<br>
        charge of the gates, whilst the rest were drawn up on the pavement<br>
        opposite and at the corner of Bridge Street, with the mission of<br>
        preventing rushes after the Claimant's carriage as it drove through.<br>
        A few minutes later the distinguished vehicle itself--a plain,<br>
        dark-blue brougham, drawn by a finely bred bay mare--drove into the<br>
        yard, and, taking up its position a little on one side of the entrance<br>
        to the Hall, became the object of curious and respectful consideration.<br>
        As the great clock boomed four strokes, the doors of the Court opened,<br>
        and the privileged few who had been present at the day's proceedings<br>
        issued forth.</p>
      <p class="main">The excitement increased as the Court emptied, culminating
        when,<br>
        after a brief lull, the Claimant himself appeared, and waddled down<br>
        the living lane that marked the route to his carriage. There was<br>
        much cheering and a great amount of pocket-handkerchief waving,<br>
        which &quot;Sir Roger&quot; acknowledged by raising his hat and smiling
        that<br>
        &quot;smile of peculiar sweetness and grace&quot; which Dr. Kenealy brought<br>
        under the notice of the three judges and a special jury. As the<br>
        Claimant walked through the doorway, closely followed by the<br>
        Inspector, the policemen on guard suddenly closed the doors, and<br>
        the public within Westminster Hall found themselves netted and<br>
        hopelessly frustrated in what was evidently their intention of<br>
        rushing out and sharing the outside crowd's privilege of staring<br>
        at the Claimant, as he actually stepped into his carriage.</p>
      <p class="main">The outside throng in Palace Yard, meanwhile, made the most
        of<br>
        their special privilege, crowding round &quot;Sir Roger&quot; and cheering<br>
        in a manner that made the bay mare plunge and rear. With the least<br>
        possible delay, the Claimant is got into the brougham, the door is<br>
        banged to, and the bay mare is driven swiftly through the Yard, the<br>
        crowd closing in behind. But when they reach the gates, and essay<br>
        to pass and flood the streets beyond, where the gigantic umbrella<br>
        of the aged gentleman looms uplifted over the shoulders of the line<br>
        of police like the section of a windmill sail, the iron gates are<br>
        swung to, and this, the second and larger portion of the crowd, is<br>
        likewise safely trapped, and can gaze upon the retreating brougham<br>
        only through iron bars that, in this instance at least, &quot;do make
        a<br>
        cage.&quot; There are not many people outside, for it is hard to catch<br>
        even a passing glimpse of the occupant of the carriage as it drives<br>
        swiftly westward to Pimlico, finally pulling up in a broad street of<br>
        a severely respectable appearance, not to be marred even by the near<br>
        contiguity of Millbank convict prison.</p>
      <p class="main">Here also is a crowd, though only a small one, and select
        to wit,<br>
        being composed chiefly of well-dressed ladies, forming part of a<br>
        band of pilgrims who daily walked up and down the street, waiting<br>
        and watching the outgoing and incoming of &quot;Sir Roger.&quot; They
        are<br>
        rewarded by the polite upraising of &quot;Sir Roger's&quot; hat, and a
        further<br>
        diffusion of the sweet and gracious smile; and having seen the door<br>
        shut upon the portly form, and having watched the brougham drive<br>
        off, they, too, go their way, and the drama is over for the day.</p>
      <p class="main">But the crowd in and about Palace Yard have not accomplished
        their<br>
        mission when they have seen the blue brougham fade in the distance.<br>
        There is the &quot;Doctor&quot; to come yet, and all the cheering has
        to be<br>
        repeated, even with added volume of sound. When the Claimant has<br>
        got clear away, and the crowd have had a moment or two of<br>
        breathing-time, the &quot;Doctor&quot; walks forth from the counsels'<br>
        entrance, and is received with a burst of cheering and clapping<br>
        of hands, which, &quot;just like Sir Roger&quot;, he acknowledges by raising<br>
        his hat, but, unlike him, permits no trace of a smile to illumine<br>
        his face. Without looking right or left, the &quot;Doctor&quot; walks<br>
        northward, raising his hat as he passes the caged and cheering<br>
        crowd in Palace Yard. With the same grave countenance, not moved in<br>
        the slightest degree by the comical effect of the big men in the<br>
        crowd at his heels waving their hats over his head, the &quot;Doctor&quot;<br>
        crosses Bridge Street, and walks into Parliament Street, as far as<br>
        the Treasury, where a cab is waiting. Into this he gets with much<br>
        deliberation, and, with a final waving of his hat, and always with<br>
        the same imperturbable countenance, is driven off, and Parliament<br>
        Street, subsiding from the turmoil in which the running, laughing,<br>
        shouting mob have temporarily thrown it, finds time to wonder<br>
        whether it would not have been more convenient for all concerned if<br>
        the &quot;Doctor's&quot; cab had picked him up at the door of Westminster
        Hall.</p>
      <p class="main">Slowly approached the end of this marvellous, and to a succeeding<br>
        generation almost incredible, and altogether inexplicable,<br>
        phenomenon. It came about noon, on Saturday, the final day of<br>
        February, 1874.</p>
      <p class="main">A few minutes before ten o'clock on that morning the familiar
        bay<br>
        mare and the well-known blue brougham--where are they now?--appeared<br>
        in sight, with a contingent of volunteer running footmen, who<br>
        cheered &quot;Sir Roger&quot; with unabated enthusiasm. As the carriage
        passed<br>
        through into the yard, a cordon of police promptly drew up behind it<br>
        across the gateway, and stopped the crowd that would have entered<br>
        with it. But inside there was, within reasonable limits, no<br>
        restraint upon the movements of the Claimant's admirers, who lustily<br>
        cheered, and wildly waved their hats, drowning in the greater sound<br>
        the hisses that came from a portion of the assemblage. The Claimant<br>
        looked many shades graver than in the days when Kenealy's speech<br>
        was in progress. Nevertheless, he smiled acknowledgment of the<br>
        reception, and repeatedly raised his hat. When he had passed in,<br>
        the throng in Palace Yard rapidly vanished, not more than a couple<br>
        of hundred remaining in a state of vague expectation. Westminster<br>
        Hall itself continued to be moderately full, a compact section of<br>
        the crowd that had secured places of vantage between the barricade<br>
        and the temporary telegraph station evidently being prepared to see<br>
        it out at whatever hour the end might come.</p>
      <p class="main">For the next hour there was scarcely any movement in the
        Hall, save<br>
        that occasioned by persons who lounged in, looked round, and either<br>
        ranged themselves in the ranks behind the policemen, or strolled<br>
        out again, holding to the generally prevalent belief that if they<br>
        returned at two o'clock they would still have sufficient hours to<br>
        wait. In the Yard a thin line extended from the side of the Hall<br>
        gateway backwards to the railings in St. Margaret's Street, with<br>
        another line drawn up across the far edge of the broad carriage-way<br>
        before the entrance. There was no ostentatious show of police, but<br>
        they had a way of silently filing out from under the sheds or out<br>
        of the Commons' gateway in proportion as the crowd thickened, which<br>
        conveyed the impression that there was a force somewhere about that<br>
        would prove sufficient to meet any emergency. As a matter of fact,<br>
        Mr. Superintendent Denning had under his command three hundred men,<br>
        who had marched down to Westminster Hall at six o'clock in the<br>
        morning, and were chiefly disposed in reserve, ready for action as<br>
        circumstances might dictate.</p>
      <p class="main">At half-past eleven, there being not more than three or
        four hundred<br>
        people in Palace Yard, a number of Press messengers, rushing<br>
        helter-skelter out of the court and into waiting cabs, indicated the<br>
        arrival of some critical juncture within the jealously guarded<br>
        portals. Presently it was whispered that the Lord Chief Justice had<br>
        finished his summing up, and that Mr. Justice Mellor was addressing<br>
        the jury. A buzz of conversation rose and fell in the Hall, and the<br>
        ranks drew closer up, waiting in silence the consummation that could<br>
        not now be far distant.</p>
      <p class="main">The news spread with surprising swiftness, not only in Palace
        Yard,<br>
        but throughout Bridge Street and St. Margaret's Street, and the<br>
        railings looking thence into the yard became gradually banked with<br>
        rows of earnest faces. Little groups formed on the pavement about<br>
        the corners of Parliament Street. Faces appeared at the windows of<br>
        the houses overlooking the Yard, and the whole locality assumed an<br>
        aspect of grave and anxious expectation. A few minutes after the<br>
        clock in the tower had slowly boomed forth twelve strokes it was<br>
        known in the Bail Court, where a dozen rapid hands were writing out<br>
        words the echo of which had scarcely died away in the inner court,<br>
        that the Judges had finished their task, and that the Jury had<br>
        retired to consider their verdict. It was known also in the lobbies,<br>
        where a throng of gowned and wigged barristers were assembled,<br>
        hanging on as the fringe of the densely packed audience that sat<br>
        behind the Claimant, and overflowed by the opened doorway. Thence<br>
        it reached the crowd outside, and after the first movement and hum<br>
        of conversation had subsided, a dead silence fell upon Westminster<br>
        Hall, and all eyes were fixed upon the door by which, at any moment,<br>
        messengers might issue with the word or words up to the utterance of<br>
        which by the Foreman of the Jury the great trial slowly dragged its<br>
        length.</p>
      <p class="main">Half an hour later the door burst open, and messengers came
        leaping<br>
        in breathless haste down the steps and across the Hall, shouting as<br>
        they ran,--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Guilty! Guilty on all counts!&quot; The words were
        taken up by the<br>
        crowd, and passed from mouth to mouth in voices scarcely above a<br>
        whisper. It was a flock of junior barristers, issuing from the<br>
        court, radiant and laughing, who brought the next news.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Fourteen years! Fourteen years!&quot; they called
        out.</p>
      <p class="main">This time the crowd in Westminster Hall took up the cry
        in louder<br>
        tones, and there was some attempt at cheering, but it did not<br>
        prevail. The less dense crowd in the Yard received the intelligence<br>
        without any demonstration and after a brief pause made off with one<br>
        consent for the judges' entrance in St. Margaret's Street, where,<br>
        peradventure, they might see the prisoner taken away, or at least<br>
        would catch a glimpse of the judges and counsel.</p>
      <p class="main">From this hour up to nearly four o'clock the crowd, in numbers
        far<br>
        exceeding those present at the first intimation of the verdict and<br>
        sentence, hung about St. Margaret's Street and Palace Yard waiting<br>
        for the coming forth of the prisoner, who had long ago been safely<br>
        lodged in Newgate. They did not know that as soon as the convict<br>
        was given in charge of the tipstaff of the court he was led away by<br>
        Inspector Denning, along a carefully planned and circuitous route<br>
        that entirely baffled the curiosity of the waiting crowd. Through the<br>
        Court of Exchequer the prisoner and his guards went, by the members'<br>
        private staircase, across the lobby, along the corridor, through the<br>
        smoking-room into the Commons Courtyard, where a plain police<br>
        omnibus was in waiting with an escort of eleven men. In this the<br>
        prisoner took his seat, and was driven through the Victoria Tower<br>
        gate <span class="italic">en route</span> for Newgate. He accompanied
        his custodians as quietly<br>
        as if they were conducting him to his brougham, and only once broke<br>
        the silence of the journey to Newgate.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;It's very hot,&quot; he said, as he panted along the
        passages of the<br>
        House of Commons, &quot;and I am so fat.&quot;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="52"></a>CHAPTER V.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">WITH PEGGOTTY AND HAM.</p>
      <p class="main">A careful survey of the map of Kent will disclose Lydd lying
        within<br>
        four miles of the coast, in the most southerly portion of the<br>
        promontory tipped by Dungeness. Lydd has now its own branch line<br>
        from Ashford, but when I first knew it the nearest point by rail on<br>
        one hand was Folkestone, and on the other Appledore. Between these<br>
        several points lies a devious road, sometimes picking its way<br>
        through the marshes, and occasionally breaking in upon a sinking<br>
        village, which it would probably be delightful to dwell in if it<br>
        did not lie so low, was not so damp, and did not furnish the<br>
        inhabitants with an opportunity for obtaining remarkably close<br>
        acquaintance with the symptoms of the ague. Few of the marsh towns<br>
        are more picturesque than Lydd, owing to the sturdy independence<br>
        shown by the architects of the houses, and to the persistent and<br>
        successful efforts made to avoid anything like a straight line in<br>
        the formation of the streets. The houses cluster &quot;anyhow&quot; round
        the<br>
        old church, and seem to have dropped accidentally down in all sorts<br>
        of odd nooks and corners. They face all ways, and stand at angles,<br>
        several going the length of turning their backs upon the streets and<br>
        placidly opening out from their front door into the nearest field.</p>
      <p class="main">In the main street, through which her Majesty's cart passes,
        and<br>
        along which all the posting is done, a serious attempt has made at<br>
        the production of something like an ordinary street. But even here<br>
        the approach to regularity is a failure, owing to some of the houses<br>
        along the line putting forth a porch, or blooming into a row of<br>
        utterly unnecessary pillars before the parlour windows. In short,<br>
        Lydd, being entirely out of the tracks of the world, cares little for<br>
        what other towns may do, and has just built its houses where and how<br>
        it pleased. Between Dungeness and Lydd there is an expanse of shingle<br>
        which makes the transit an arduous undertaking, and one not to be<br>
        accomplished easily without the aid of &quot;backstays&quot; (pronounced<br>
        &quot;backster&quot;), a simple contrivance somewhat upon the principle
        of<br>
        snowshoes. When the proneness to slip off the unaccustomed foot has<br>
        been overcome, backstays are not so awkward as they look. A couple of<br>
        flat pieces of inch-thick wood, four inches wide by six long, with a<br>
        loop of leather defectively fastened for the insertion of the foot<br>
        went to make up the pair of &quot;backsters&quot; by whose assistance
        I<br>
        succeeded in traversing two miles of rough, loose shingle that<br>
        separates the southern and eastern edge of Lydd marsh from the sea.</p>
      <p class="main">The lighthouse stands on the farthest point, jutting into
        the sea,<br>
        and has at the right of it West Bay, and on the left East Bay. A<br>
        signboard on the top of a pole stuck in the shingle, almost within<br>
        hail of the lighthouse, announces the proximity of &quot;The Pilot.&quot;
        &quot;The<br>
        Pilot&quot; is a small shanty run up on the shingle, and possessed of<br>
        accommodation about equal in extent to that afforded by the<br>
        residence of the Peggottys. Reminiscences of the well-known abode on<br>
        the beach at Yarmouth are further favoured, as we draw nearer, by<br>
        the appearance of the son of the house, who comes lounging out in a<br>
        pilot-cloth suit, with a telescope under his arm, and a smile of<br>
        welcome upon his bright, honest face. This must be Ham, who we find<br>
        occupies the responsible position of signalman at this station, and<br>
        frequently has the current of his life stirred by the appearance of<br>
        strange sail upon the horizon. Peggotty, his father, is the proprietor<br>
        of &quot;The Pilot,&quot; which hostelry drives a more or less extensive
        trade<br>
        in malt liquor with the eight men constituting the garrison of a<br>
        neighbouring fort, supplemented by such stray customers as wind and<br>
        tide may bring in.</p>
      <p class="main">I made the acquaintance of the Peggotty family and was made
        free of<br>
        the cabin many years ago, in the dark winter time when the <span class="italic">Northfleet</span><br>
        went down off Dungeness, and over three hundred passengers were lost.<br>
        All the coast was then alive with expectancy of some moment finding<br>
        the sea crowded with the bodies of the drowned. The nine days during<br>
        which, according to all experience at Dungeness, the sea might hold<br>
        its dead were past, and at any moment the resurrection might<br>
        commence. But it never came, and other theories had to be broached<br>
        to explain the unprecedented circumstance. The most generally<br>
        acceptable, because the most absolutely irrefragable, was that the<br>
        dead men and women had been carried away by an under-current out<br>
        into the Atlantic, and for ever lost amid its wilds.</p>
      <p class="main">My old friend Peggotty tells me, in a quiet, matter-of-fact
        manner,<br>
        a story much more weird than this. He says that after we watchers<br>
        had left the scene, the divers got fairly to work and attained a<br>
        fair run of the ship. They found she lay broadside on to a bank of<br>
        sand, by the edge of which she had sunk till it overtopped her<br>
        decks. By the action of the tide the sand had drifted over the ship,<br>
        and had even at that early date commenced to bury her. The bodies<br>
        of the passengers were there by the hundred, all huddled together<br>
        on the lee-side.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;The divers could not see them,&quot; Peggotty adds,
        &quot;for what with the<br>
        mud and sand the water is pretty thick down there. But they could<br>
        feel them well enough--an arm sticking out there, and a knee sticking<br>
        out here, and sometimes half a body clear of the silt, owing to lying<br>
        one over another. They could have got them all up easy enough, and<br>
        would, too, if they had been paid for it. They were told that they<br>
        were to have a pound apiece for all they brought up. They sent up<br>
        one, but there was no money for it, and no one particularly glad to<br>
        see it, and so they left them all there, snug enough as far as<br>
        burying goes. The diving turned out a poor affair altogether. The<br>
        cargo wasn't much good for bringing up, bein' chiefly railway iron,<br>
        spades, and such like. There were one or two sales at Dover of odd<br>
        stores they brought up, but it didn't fetch in much altogether, and<br>
        they soon gave up the job as a bad un.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The years have brought little change to this strange out-of-the-way<br>
        corner of the world, an additional wreck or two being scarcely a<br>
        noteworthy incident. The section of an old boat in which, with<br>
        fortuitous bits of building tacked on at odd times as necessity has<br>
        arisen, the Peggottys live is as brightly tarred as ever, and still<br>
        stoutly braves the gales in which many a fine ship has foundered<br>
        just outside the front door. One peculiarity of the otherwise<br>
        desirable residence is that, with the wind blowing either from the<br>
        eastward, westward, or southward, Mrs. Peggotty will never allow<br>
        the front door to be opened. As these quarters of the wind<br>
        comprehend a considerable stretch of possible weather, the<br>
        consequence is that the visitor approaching the house in the usual<br>
        manner is on eight days out of ten disturbed by the apparition of<br>
        Peggotty at the little look-out window, violently, and to the<br>
        stranger, mysteriously, beckoning him away to the northward,<br>
        apparently in the direction of the lighthouse.</p>
      <p class="main">This means, however, only that he is to go round by the
        back, and<br>
        the <span class="italic">d&eacute;tour</span> is not to be regretted,
        as it leads by Peggotty's garden,<br>
        which in its way is a marvel, a monument of indomitable struggle<br>
        with adverse circumstances. It is not a large plot of ground, and<br>
        perhaps looks unduly small by reason of being packed in by a high<br>
        paling, made of the staves of wrecked barrels and designed to keep<br>
        the sand and grit from blowing across it. But it is large enough<br>
        to produce a serviceable crop of potatoes, which, with peas and<br>
        beans galore occupy the centre beds, Peggotty indulging a weakness<br>
        for wallflowers and big red tulips on the narrow fringe of soil<br>
        running under the shadow of the palings. The peculiarity about the<br>
        garden is that every handful of soil that lies upon it has been<br>
        carried on Peggotty's back across the four-mile waste of shingle<br>
        that separates the sea-coast from Lydd. That is, perhaps, as severe<br>
        a test as could be applied to a man's predilection for a garden.<br>
        There are many people who like to have a bit of garden at the back<br>
        of their house. But how many would gratify their taste at the expense<br>
        of bringing the soil on their own backs, plodding on &quot;backstays&quot;<br>
        over four miles of loose shingle?</p>
      <p class="main">One important change has happened in this little household
        since I<br>
        last sat by its hearthstone. Ham is married, and is, in some<br>
        incomprehensible manner, understood to reside both at Lydd with<br>
        Mrs. Ham and at the cabin with his mother. As for Mrs. Peggotty,<br>
        she is as lively and as &quot;managing&quot; as ever--perhaps a trifle
        smaller<br>
        in appearance, and with her smooth clean face more than ever<br>
        suggestive of the idea of a pebble smoothed and shaped by the action<br>
        of the tide.</p>
      <p class="main">I find on chatting with Peggotty that the old gentleman's
        mind is in<br>
        somewhat of a chaotic state with respect to the wrecks that abound<br>
        in the bay. He has been here for forty-eight years, and the fact is,<br>
        in that time, he has seen so many wrecks that the timbers are, as it<br>
        were, floating in an indistinguishable mass through his mind, and<br>
        when he tries to recall events connected with them, the jib-boom of<br>
        &quot;the <span class="italic">Rhoda</span> brig&quot; gets mixed up with
        the rigging of &quot;the <span class="italic">Spendthrift</span>,&quot;<br>
        and &quot;the <span class="italic">Branch</span>, a coal-loaded brig,&quot;
        that came to grief thirty years<br>
        ago, gets inextricably mixed up with the &quot;Rooshian wessel.&quot;
        But,<br>
        looking with far-away gaze towards the Ness Lighthouse, and sweeping<br>
        slowly round as far east as New Romney, Peggotty can tot off a number<br>
        of wrecks, now to be seen at low water, which with others, the names<br>
        whereof he &quot;can't just remember,&quot; bring the total past a score.</p>
      <p class="main">The first he sees on this side of the lighthouse is the
        <span class="italic">Mary</span>, a bit<br>
        of black hull that has been lying there for more than twenty years.<br>
        She was &quot;bound somewheres in France,&quot; and running round the
        Ness,<br>
        looking for shelter in the bay, stuck fast in the sand, &quot;and broke<br>
        up in less than no time.&quot; She was loaded with linseed and<br>
        millstones, which I suspect, from a slight tinge of sadness in<br>
        Peggotty's voice as he mentioned the circumstance, is not for people<br>
        living on the coast the best cargo which ships that <span class="italic">will</span>
        go down in<br>
        the bay might be loaded with. Indeed, I may remark that though<br>
        Peggotty, struggling with the recollections of nearly fifty years,<br>
        frequently fails to remember the name of the ship whose wreck shows<br>
        up through the sand, the nature of her cargo comes back to him with<br>
        singular freshness.</p>
      <p class="main">Near the <span class="italic">Mary</span> is another French
        ship, which had been brought to<br>
        anchor there in order that the captain might run ashore and visit<br>
        the ship's agent at Lydd. Whilst he was ashore a gale of wind came<br>
        on &quot;easterdly&quot;; ship drifted down on Ness Point, and knocked
        right<br>
        up on the shore, the crew scrambling out on to dry land as she went<br>
        to pieces. Another bit of wreck over there is all that is left of the<br>
        <span class="italic">Westbourne</span>, of Chichester, coal-laden. She
        was running for Ness Point<br>
        at night, and, getting too far in, struck where she lay, and all the<br>
        crew save one were drowned. Nearer is the <span class="italic">Branch</span>,
        also a coal-loaded<br>
        brig, a circumstance which suggests to Peggotty the parenthetical<br>
        remark that &quot;at times there is a good deal of coal about the shingle.&quot;<br>
        A little more to the east is &quot;the Rooshian wessel <span class="italic">Nicholas
        I</span>.,&quot; in<br>
        which Peggotty has a special interest so strong that he forgets to<br>
        mention what her cargo was. It is forty-six years since <span class="italic">Nicholas
        I.</span><br>
        came to grief; and no other help being near, the whole of the crew<br>
        were saved through the instrumentality of Peggotty's dog. It was<br>
        broad daylight, with a sea running no boat could live in. The<br>
        &quot;Rooshian&quot; was rapidly breaking up, and the crew were shrieking
        in<br>
        an unknown tongue, the little group on shore well knowing that the<br>
        unfamiliar sound was a cry for help. Peggotty's Newfoundland dog was<br>
        there, barking with mad delight at the huge waves that came tumbling<br>
        on the shore, when it occurred to Peggotty that perhaps the dog<br>
        could swim out to the drowning men. So he signalled him off, and in<br>
        the dog went, gallantly buffeting the waves till it reached the ship.<br>
        The Russian sailors tied a piece of rope to a stick, put the stick in<br>
        the dog's mouth, and he, leaping overboard, carried it safely to<br>
        shore, and a line of communication being thus formed, every soul on<br>
        board was saved.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;They've got it in the school-books for the little
        children to<br>
        read,&quot; Peggotty says, permitting himself to indulge in the<br>
        slightest possible chuckle. I could not ascertain what particular<br>
        school-book was meant, because last winter, when another Russian<br>
        ship came ashore here and was totally wrecked, Peggotty presented<br>
        the captain with his only copy of the work as a souvenir of the<br>
        compulsory visit. But when we returned to the cabin, Mrs. Peggotty<br>
        brought down a faded, yellow, much-worn copy of the <span class="italic">Kent
        Herald</span>,<br>
        in which an account of the incident appears among other items of<br>
        the local news of the day.</p>
      <p class="main">Further eastward are the remains of a West Indiaman, loaded
        with<br>
        mahogany and turtles, the latter disappearing in a manner still a<br>
        marvel at Dungeness, whilst of the former a good deal of salvage<br>
        money was made. It is not far from this wreck that the Russian<br>
        last-mentioned came to grief. She met her fate in a peculiarly sad<br>
        manner. The <span class="italic">Alliance</span>, a tar-loaded vessel,
        drifting inwards before<br>
        a strong east wind, began to burn pitch barrels as a signal for<br>
        assistance. The Russian, thinking she was on fire, ran down to her<br>
        assistance, and took the ground close by. Both ships were totally<br>
        wrecked, and the crews saved with no other property save<br>
        the clothes they stood in.</p>
      <p class="main">Still glancing from Dungeness eastward, we see at every
        hundred<br>
        yards a black mass of timber, sometimes showing the full length of<br>
        a ship, oftener only a few jagged ribs marking where the carcase<br>
        lies deeply embedded. Each has its name and its history, and is a<br>
        memento of some terrible disaster in which strong ships have been<br>
        broken up as if they were built of cardboard, and through which<br>
        men and women have not always successfully struggled for life.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;We don't have so much loss of life in this bay as
        in the west bay<br>
        round the point,&quot; said Ham. &quot;Here, you see, when there's been
        a<br>
        rumpus, the water quiets soon after, and the shipwrecked folk can<br>
        take to their boats; on the other side the water is rougher, and<br>
        there's less chance for them. There was one wreck here not long<br>
        since, though, when all hands were lost. It was a Danish ship that<br>
        came running down one stormy night, and run ashore there before<br>
        she could make the light. We saw her flash her flare-up lights,<br>
        and made ready to help her, but before we could get up she went to<br>
        pieces, and what is most singular, never since has a body been seen<br>
        from the wreck. Ah, sir, it's a bad spot. Often between Saturday<br>
        and Monday you'll see three fine ships all stranded together on this<br>
        beach. When there's a big wreck like the <span class="italic">Northfleet
        </span>over there,<br>
        everybody talks about it, and all the world knows full particulars.<br>
        But there's many and many a shipwreck here the newspapers never<br>
        notice, and hundreds of ships get on, and with luck get off, without<br>
        a word being said anywhere.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;There's mother signallin' the heggs and bakin is done,&quot;
        said<br>
        Peggotty, looking back at the cabin, where a white apron waved out<br>
        of one of the port-holes that served for window.</p>
      <p class="main">So we turned and left this haunted spot, where, with the
        ebbing<br>
        tide, twenty-three wrecks, one after the other, thrust forth a<br>
        rugged rib or a jagged spar to remind the passer-by of a tragedy.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="62"></a>CHAPTER VI.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">TO THOSE ABOUT TO BECOME JOURNALISTS.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">AN OPEN LETTER.</p>
      <p class="main">My dear young friends,__<br>
        I suppose no one not prominently engaged in journalism knows how<br>
        widely spread is the human conviction that, failing all else, any<br>
        one can &quot;write for the papers,&quot; making a lucrative living on
        easy<br>
        terms, amid agreeable circumstances. I have often wondered how<br>
        Dickens, familiar as he was with this frailty, did not make use of<br>
        it in the closing epoch of Micawber's life before he quitted<br>
        England. Knowing what he did, as letters coming to light at this<br>
        day testify, it would seem to be the most natural thing in the<br>
        world that finally, nothing else having turned up, it should occur<br>
        to Dickens that Mr. Micawber would join the Press--probably as<br>
        editor, certainly on the editorial staff, possibly as dramatic<br>
        critic, a position which involves a free run of the theatres and a<br>
        more than nodding acquaintance with the dramatic stars of the day.</p>
      <p class="main">Perhaps Dickens avoided this episode because it was too
        literally<br>
        near the truth in the life of the person who, all unconsciously,<br>
        stood as the lay figure of David Copperfield's incomparable friend.<br>
        It is, I believe, not generally known that Charles Dickens's father<br>
        did in his last desolate days become a member of the Press. When<br>
        Dickens was made editor of the Daily News, he thoughtfully provided<br>
        for his father by installing him leader of the Parliamentary Corps<br>
        of that journal. The old gentleman, of course, knew nothing of<br>
        journalism, was not even capable of shorthand. Providentially he<br>
        was not required to take notes, but generally to overlook things,<br>
        a post which exactly suited Mr. Micawber. So he was inducted, and<br>
        filled the office even for a short time after his son had<br>
        impetuously vacated the editorial chair. Only the other day there<br>
        died an original member of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>
        Parliamentary Corps, who<br>
        told me he quite well remembered his first respected leader, his<br>
        grandly vague conception of his duties, and his almost ducal manner<br>
        of not performing them.</p>
      <p class="main">Of the many letters that come to me with the assurance that
        I have<br>
        in my possession blank appointments on the editorial and reportorial<br>
        staff of all contemporary journals paying good salaries, the saddest<br>
        are those written by more than middle-aged men with families. Some<br>
        have for years been earning a precarious living as reporters or<br>
        sub-editors on obscure papers, and now find themselves adrift;<br>
        others are men who, having vainly knocked at all other gates, are<br>
        flushed by the happy thought that at least they can write<br>
        acceptably for the newspapers; others, again, already engaged in<br>
        daily work, are anxious to burn the midnight oil, and so add<br>
        something to a scanty income. These last are chiefly clergymen and<br>
        schoolmasters--educated men with a love of letters and the idea that,<br>
        since it is easy and pleasant to read, it must be easy to write, and<br>
        that in the immensity of newspapers and periodical literature there<br>
        would be not only room, but eager welcome for them.</p>
      <p class="main">This class of correspondents is curiously alike in one feature.<br>
        There is an almost sprightliness in their conviction that what they<br>
        can write in these circumstances would exactly suit any paper, daily<br>
        or weekly, morning or evening. All they have to do is to give up<br>
        their odd savings of time to the work; all you--their hapless<br>
        correspondent--have to do is to fill up one of those blank<br>
        appointments with which your desk is clogged, and send it to them<br>
        by first post.</p>
      <p class="main">There is no other profession in the world thus viewed by
        outsiders.<br>
        No one supposes he can make boots, cut clothes, or paint the outside<br>
        of a house without having served some sort of apprenticeship, not to<br>
        mention the possession of special aptitude. Any one can, right off--,<br>
        become a journalist. Such as these, and all those about to become<br>
        journalists, I would advise to study a book published several years<br>
        ago. It is the <span class="italic">Life of James MacDonell</span>, a
        name which, before this<br>
        book was published, was an idle sound to the outer world, though to<br>
        contemporary workers in the inner circle of the Press Macdonell was<br>
        known as one of the ablest and most brilliant of modern journalists.<br>
        In these short and simple annals, the aspirant who imagines the<br>
        successful journalist's life is all beer and skittles will discover<br>
        what patient study, what self-denial, what strenuous effort, and,<br>
        more essential than all, what rare natural gifts are needed to<br>
        achieve the position into which Macdonell toiled.</p>
      <p class="main">It is this last consideration that makes me doubt whether
        there is<br>
        any utility in offering practical hints &quot;To Those about to become<br>
        Journalists.&quot; If a boy or youth has in him the journalistic faculty,<br>
        it will come out, whatever unpromising or adverse circumstances he<br>
        may be born to. If he has it not, he had very much better take to<br>
        joinering or carpentering, to clerking, or to the dispensation of<br>
        goods over the retail counter. Journalism is an honourable and,<br>
        for those specially adapted, a lucrative profession. But it is a<br>
        poor business for the man who has mistaken his way into it. The<br>
        very fact that it has such strong allurement for human nature makes<br>
        harder the struggle for life with those engaged in its pursuit. I<br>
        gather from facts brought under my personal notice that at the<br>
        present time there are, proportionately with its numbers, more<br>
        unemployed in the business of journalism than in any other, not<br>
        exceeding that of the dockers. When a vacancy occurs on any staff,<br>
        the rush to fill it is tremendous. Where no vacancy exists the<br>
        knocking at the doors is incessant. All the gates are thronged<br>
        with suitors, and the accommodation is exceedingly limited.</p>
      <p class="main">The first thing the youth who turns his face earnestly towards<br>
        journalism should convince himself of is, that the sole guiding<br>
        principle controlling admission to the Press or advance in its ranks<br>
        is merit. This, as your communications, my dear young friends, have<br>
        convinced me, is a statement in direct contravention of general<br>
        belief. You are convinced that it is all done by patronage, and that<br>
        if only some one in authority will interest himself in you, you<br>
        straightway enter upon a glorious career. There is, however, no<br>
        royal road to advancement on the Press. Proprietors and editors<br>
        simply could not afford it. Living as newspapers do in the fierce<br>
        light focussed from a million eyes, fighting daily with keen<br>
        competition, the instinct of self-preservation compels their<br>
        directors to engage the highest talent where it is discoverable,<br>
        and, failing that, the most sedulously nurtured skill. For this they<br>
        will pay almost anything; and they ask nothing more, neither<br>
        blood-relationship, social distinction, nor even academic training.<br>
        In journalism, more than in any other profession, not excepting the<br>
        Bar, a man gets on by his own effort, and only by that. Of course,<br>
        proprietors, and even editors, may, if the commercial prosperity of<br>
        their journal permit the self-indulgence, find salaried situations<br>
        for brothers, sons, or nephews or may oblige old friends in the<br>
        same direction. Charles Dickens, as we have seen, made his father<br>
        manager of the Parliamentary Corps of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>.
        But that did<br>
        not make him a journalist, nor did he, after his son's severance of<br>
        his connection with the paper, long retain the post.</p>
      <p class="main">This line of reflection is, I am afraid, not encouraging
        to you, my<br>
        dear young friends; but it leads up to one fact in which I trust<br>
        you will be justified in finding ground for hope. Amongst the crowd<br>
        struggling to obtain a footing within the pale of journalism, the<br>
        reiterated rebuffs they meet with naturally lead to the conviction<br>
        that it is a sort of close borough, those already in possession<br>
        jealously resenting the efforts of outsiders to breach its sacred<br>
        portals. Nothing could be further removed from the fact. A nugget of<br>
        gold is not more pleasing to the sight of the anxious miner than is<br>
        the discovery by the editor or manager of a newspaper of a new light<br>
        in the world of journalism. This I put in the forefront of friendly<br>
        words of advice to those about to enter journalism. Get rid of the<br>
        fatal idea that some one will open the door for you and land you<br>
        safely inside. You must force the door yourself with incessant<br>
        knocking if need be, prepared for searching inquiry as to your right<br>
        to enter, but certain of a hearty welcome and fraternal assistance<br>
        when you have proved your right.</p>
      <p class="main">As an ounce of example is worth a ton of precept, I may
        perhaps<br>
        mention that in a journalistic career now extending over just<br>
        twenty-five years, I never but once received anything in the way of<br>
        patronage, and that was extended at the very outset only after a<br>
        severe test of the grounds upon which recommendation could be made.<br>
        My parents, in their wisdom, destined me for a commercial career.<br>
        If I had followed the bent given me when I left school, I should<br>
        now have been a very indifferent clerk in the hide and valonia<br>
        business. But like you, my dear young friends, I felt that my true<br>
        vocation was journalism, and I determined to be a journalist.</p>
      <p class="main">I will tell you exactly how I did it. Like you, I meant
        to be an<br>
        editor some day, but also, I trust, like you, I felt that it would<br>
        be convenient, if not necessary to start by being a reporter. So I<br>
        began to study shorthand, teaching myself by Pitman's system. When,<br>
        after infinite pains, I had mastered this mystery, I began to look<br>
        out for an opening on the Press. I had no friends in journalism, not<br>
        the remotest acquaintance. I made the tour of the newspaper offices<br>
        in the town where I lived, was more or less courteously received,<br>
        and uniformly assured that there was no opening. One exception was<br>
        made by a dear friend whose name is to-day known and honoured<br>
        throughout Great Britain, who was then the young assistant-editor of<br>
        a local daily paper. He gave me some trial work to do, and was so<br>
        far satisfied that he promised me the first vacancy on the junior<br>
        staff of reporters.</p>
      <p class="main">That was excellent, but I did not sit down waiting till
        fortune<br>
        dropped the promised plum into my mouth. I got at all the newspapers<br>
        within reach, searched for advertisements for reporters, answered<br>
        them day after day, week after week, even month after month,<br>
        without response. At last a cautious inquiry came. The reply was<br>
        deemed satisfactory, and I got my chance.</p>
      <p class="main">This, dear young friends, is the short and simple annal
        of my start<br>
        in journalism, and you will see that the pathway is equally open to<br>
        you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="69"></a>CHAPTER VII.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">A CINQUE PORT.</p>
      <p class="main">Skulls piled roof high in the vault beneath the church tower
        supply<br>
        the only show thing Hythe possesses. There is some doubt as to their<br>
        precise nationality, but of their existence there can be none, as any<br>
        visitor to the town may see for himself on payment of sixpence<br>
        (parties of three or more eighteenpence). It is known how within a<br>
        time to which memory distinctly goes the skulls were found down upon<br>
        the beach, whole piles of them, thick as shingle on this coast. The<br>
        explanation of their tenancy of British ground is popularly referred<br>
        to the time, now nearly nine hundred years gone by, when Earl Godwin,<br>
        being exiled, made a raid on this conveniently accessible part of<br>
        England, and after a hard fight captured all the vessels lying in<br>
        the haven. Others find in the peculiar formation of the crania proof<br>
        positive that the skulls originally came from Denmark.</p>
      <p class="main">But Saxon or Dane, or whatever they be, it is certain the
        skulls<br>
        were picked up on the beach, and after an interval were, with some<br>
        dim notion of decency, carried up to the church, where they lay<br>
        neglected in a vault. The church also going to decay, the<br>
        determination was taken to rebuild it, and being sorely pressed for<br>
        funds a happy thought occurred to a practical vicar. He had the<br>
        skulls piled up wall-like in an accessible chamber, caused the<br>
        passages to be swept and garnished, and then put on the impost<br>
        mentioned above, the receipts helping to liquidate the debt on<br>
        the building fund. Thus, by a strange irony of fate, after eight<br>
        centuries, all that is left of these heathens brings in sixpences<br>
        to build up a Christian church.</p>
      <p class="main">A good deal has happened in Hythe since the skulls first
        began to<br>
        bleach on the inhospitable shore. When Earl Godwin suddenly<br>
        appeared with his helm hard up for Hythe, the little town on the<br>
        hill faced one of the best havens on the coast. It was, as every<br>
        one knows, one of the Cinque Ports, and at the time of the<br>
        Conqueror undertook to furnish, as its quota of armament, five<br>
        ships, one hundred and five men, and five boys. Even in the time<br>
        of Elizabeth there was a fair harbour here. But long ago the sea<br>
        changed all that. It occupied itself in its leisure moments by<br>
        bringing up illimitable shingle, with which it filled up all water<br>
        ways, and cut Hythe off from communication with the sea as<br>
        completely as if it were Canterbury.</p>
      <p class="main">It is not without a feeling of humiliation that a burgess
        of the<br>
        once proud port of Hythe can watch the process of the occasional<br>
        importation of household coal. Where Earl Godwin swooped down over<br>
        twenty fathoms of water the little collier now painfully picks her<br>
        way at high water. On shore stand the mariners of Hythe (in number<br>
        four), manning the capstan. When the collier gets within a certain<br>
        distance a hawser is thrown out, the capstan turns more or less<br>
        merrily round, and the collier is beached, so that at low water<br>
        she will stand high and dry.</p>
      <p class="main">Thus ignominiously is coal landed at one of the Cinque Ports.</p>
      <p class="main">Of course this change in the water approaches has altogether<br>
        revolutionised the character of the place. Hythe is a port without<br>
        imports or exports, a harbour in which nothing takes refuge but<br>
        shingle. It has not even fishing boats, for lack of place to moor<br>
        them in. It is on the greatest water highway of the world, and yet<br>
        has no part in its traffic. Standing on the beach you may see day<br>
        after day a never-ending fleet of ships sailing up or down as the<br>
        wind blows east or west. But, like the Levite in the parable, they<br>
        all pass by on the other side. Hythe has nothing to do but to stand<br>
        on the beach with its hands in its pockets and lazily watch them.</p>
      <p class="main">Thus cut off from the world by sea, and by land leading
        nowhere in<br>
        particular except to Romney Marshes, Hythe has preserved in an<br>
        unusual degree the flavour of our earlier English world. There have<br>
        indeed been times when endeavour was made to profit by this<br>
        isolation. As one of the Cinque Ports Hythe has since Parliaments<br>
        first sat had the privilege of returning representatives. In the<br>
        time of James II. it seems to have occurred to the Mayor (an<br>
        ancestor of one of the members for West Kent in a recent<br>
        Parliament), that since a member had to be returned to Parliament<br>
        much trouble would be saved, and no one in London would be any the<br>
        wiser, if he quietly, in his capacity as returning officer,<br>
        returned himself. But some envious Radical setting on the opposite<br>
        benches, was too sharp for him, and we find the sequel of the story<br>
        set forth in the Journals of the House of Commons under date 1685,<br>
        where it is written--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Information given that the Mayor of Hythe had returned
        himself:<br>
        Resolved by the House of Commons that Mr. Julius Deedes, the Mayor,<br>
        is not duly elected. New writ ordered in his stead.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Hythe is a little better known now, but not much. And yet
        for many<br>
        reasons its acquaintance is worth forming. The town itself, lying<br>
        snugly at the foot of the hill crowned by the old church, is full<br>
        of those bits of colour and quaintnesses of wall and gable-end<br>
        which good people cross the Channel to see. In the High-street there<br>
        is a building the like of which probably does not anywhere exist. It<br>
        is now a fish-shop, not too well stocked, where a few dried herrings<br>
        hang on a string under massive eaves that have seen the birth and<br>
        death of centuries. From the centre of the roof there rises a sort<br>
        of watch-tower, whence, before the houses on the more modern side of<br>
        the street were built, when the sea swept over what is now<br>
        meadow-land, keen eyes could scan the bay on the look out for<br>
        inconvenient visitors connected with the coastguard. When the sea<br>
        prevented Hythe honestly earning its living in deep-keeled boats, it<br>
        perforce took to smuggling, a business in which this old watch-tower<br>
        played a prominent part.</p>
      <p class="main">This is a special though neglected bit of house architecture
        in<br>
        Hythe. But everywhere, save in the quarters by the railway station<br>
        or the Parade, where new residences are beginning to spring up, the<br>
        eye is charmed by old brown houses roofed with red tiles, often<br>
        standing tree-shaded in a bountiful flower garden, and always<br>
        preserving their own lines of frontage and their own angle of gable,<br>
        with delightful indifference to the geometric scale of their<br>
        neighbour.</p>
      <p class="main">The South-Eastern Railway Company have laid their iron hand
        on<br>
        Hythe, and its old-world stillness is already on Bank Holidays and<br>
        other bleak periods of the passing year broken by the babble of<br>
        the excursionist. In its characteristically quiet way Hythe has<br>
        long been known as what is called a watering-place. When I first<br>
        knew it, it had a Parade, on which were built eight or ten houses,<br>
        whither in the season came quiet families, with children and<br>
        nurses. For a few weeks they gave to the sea frontage quite a<br>
        lively appearance, which the mariners (when they were not manning<br>
        the capstan) contemplated with complacency, and said to each other<br>
        that Hythe was &quot;looking up.&quot; For the convenience of these visitors<br>
        some enterprising person embarked on the purchase of three bathing<br>
        machines, and there are traditions of times when these were all in<br>
        use at the same hour--so great was the influx of visitors.</p>
      <p class="main">Also there is a &quot;bathing establishment&quot; built
        a long way after<br>
        the model of the Pavilion at Brighton. The peculiarity of this<br>
        bathing establishment is or was when I first knew the charming<br>
        place that regularly at the end of September the pump gets out of<br>
        order, and the new year is far advanced before the solitary plumber<br>
        of the place gets it put right. He begins to walk dreamily round<br>
        the place at Easter. At Whitsuntide he brings down an iron vessel<br>
        containing unmelted solder, and early in July the pump is mended.</p>
      <p class="main">This mending of the pump is one of the epochs of Hythe,
        a sure<br>
        harbinger of the approaching season. In July &quot;The Families&quot;
        begin<br>
        to come down, and the same people come every year, for visitors to<br>
        Hythe share in the privilege of the inhabitants, inasmuch as they<br>
        never--or hardly ever--die. Of late years, since the indefatigable<br>
        Town Clerk has succeeded in waking up the inhabitants to the<br>
        possibilities of the great future that lies before their town, not<br>
        only has a new system of drainage and water been introduced, but a<br>
        register has been kept of the death-rate. From a return, published<br>
        by the Medical Officer of Health, it appears that the death-rate of<br>
        Hythe was 9.3 per 1000. Of sixty-three people who died in a year out<br>
        of a population of some four thousand, twenty-three were upwards of<br>
        sixty years of age, many of them over eighty. Perhaps the best<br>
        proof of the healthfulness of Hythe is to be found in a stroll<br>
        through the churchyard, whence it would appear that only very<br>
        young children or very old people are carried up the hill.</p>
      <p class="main">The difficulty about Hythe up to recent times has been the<br>
        comparative absence of accommodation for visitors. Its fame has<br>
        been slowly growing as The Families have spread it within their<br>
        own circles. But it was no use for strangers to go to Hythe, since<br>
        they could not be taken in. This is slowly changing. Eligible<br>
        building sites are offered, villas have been run up along the<br>
        Sandgate Road, and an hotel has been built by the margin of the<br>
        sea. When news reached the tower of the church that down on the<br>
        beach there had risen a handsome hotel, fitted with all the<br>
        luxuries of modern life, it is no wonder that the skulls turned<br>
        on each other and--as Longfellow in the &quot;Skeleton in Armour&quot;
        puts<br>
        it--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Then from those cavernous eyes<br>
          Pale flashes seem to rise,<br>
          As when the northern skies<br>
          Gleam In December.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main"><img src="images/whitethorn.jpg" alt="Whitethorn, Hythe, Kent" width="465" height="347"></p>
      <p class="main">This is surely the beginning of the end. Having been endowed
        with a<br>
        railway which brings passengers down from London in a little over<br>
        two hours, Hythe is now dowered with an hotel in which they may dine<br>
        and sleep. The existence of the hotel being necessarily admitted,<br>
        prejudice must not prevent the further admission that it is<br>
        exceedingly well done. Architecturally it is a curiosity, seeing<br>
        that though it presents a stately and substantial front neither<br>
        stone nor brick enters into its composition. It is made entirely<br>
        of shingle mixed with mortar, the whole forming a concrete<br>
        substance as durable as granite. The first pebble of the new hotel<br>
        was laid quite a respectable number of years ago, the ceremony<br>
        furnishing an almost dangerous flux of excitement to the mariners<br>
        at the capstan. It has grown up slowly, as becomes an undertaking<br>
        connected with Hythe. But it is finished now, handsome without,<br>
        comfortable within, with views from the front stretching seawards<br>
        from Dungeness to Folkestone, and at the back across green pastures,<br>
        glimpses are caught through the trees of the red-tiled town.</p>
      <p class="main">Now that suitable accommodation is provided for stray visitors,<br>
        Hythe, with its clean beach, its parade that will presently join<br>
        hands with Sandgate, its excellent bathing, and its bracing air,<br>
        may look to take high rank among watering places suburban to<br>
        London. But there are greater charms even than these in the<br>
        immediate neighbourhood. With some knowledge of English watering<br>
        places, I solemnly declare that none is set in a country of such<br>
        beauty as is spread behind Hythe. Unlike the neighbourhood of<br>
        most watering places, the country immediately at the back of the<br>
        town is hilly and well wooded. Long shady roads lead past blooming<br>
        gardens or through rich farms, till they end in some sleepy village<br>
        or hamlet, the world forgetting, by the world forgot. In late July<br>
        the country is perfect in its loveliness. The fields and woods are<br>
        not so flowery as in May, though by way of compensation the gardens<br>
        are rich in roses. Still there are sufficient wild flowers to<br>
        gladden the eye wherever it turns. From the hedgerows big white<br>
        convolvulus stare with wonder-wide eyes, the honeysuckle is out,<br>
        the wild geranium blooms in the long grass, the blackberry bushes<br>
        are in full flower, and the poppies blaze forth in great clusters<br>
        at every turn of the road. The corn is only just beginning to turn<br>
        a faint yellow, but the haymakers are at work, and every breath of<br>
        the joyous wind carries the sweet scent of hay.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="77"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">OYSTERS AND ARCACHON.</p>
      <p class="main">If the name had not been appropriated elsewhere, Arcachon
        might<br>
        well be called the Salt Lake City. It lies on the south shore of<br>
        a basin sixty-eight miles in circumference, into which, through a<br>
        narrow opening, the Bay of Biscay rolls its illimitable waters.<br>
        Little more than thirty years ago the town was represented by half<br>
        a dozen huts inhabited by fishermen. It was a terribly lonely place,<br>
        with the smooth lake in front of it, the Atlantic thundering on the<br>
        dunes beyond, and in the rear the melancholy desert of sand known as<br>
        the Landes.</p>
      <p class="main">The Landes is peopled by a strange race, of whom the traveller<br>
        speeding along the railway to-day may catch occasional glimpses.<br>
        Early in the century the department was literally a sandy plain,<br>
        about as productive as Sahara, and in the summer time nearly as hot.<br>
        But folks must live, and they exist on the Landes, picking up a<br>
        scanty living, and occasionally dying for lack of water. One initial<br>
        difficulty in the way of getting along in the Landes is the sheer<br>
        impossibility of walking. When the early settler left his hut to pay<br>
        a morning call or walk about his daily duties, he sank ankle deep in<br>
        sand.</p>
      <p class="main">But the human mind invariably rises superior to difficulties
        of this<br>
        character.</p>
      <p class="main">What the &quot;backstay&quot; is to the inhabitant of the
        district around Lydd,<br>
        the stilts are to the lonely dwellers in the Landes. The peasants of<br>
        the department are not exactly born on stilts, but a child learns to<br>
        walk on them about the age that his British brother is beginning to<br>
        toddle on foot.</p>
      <p class="main">Stilts have the elementary recommendation of overcoming
        the difficulty<br>
        of moving about in the Landes. In addition, they raise a man to a<br>
        commanding altitude, and enable him to go about his daily business at<br>
        a pace forbidden to ordinary pedestrians. The stilts are, in truth,<br>
        a modern realisation of the gift of the seven-league boots. They are<br>
        so much a part of the daily life of the people that, except when he<br>
        stoops his head to enter his hut, the peasant of the Landes would as<br>
        soon think of taking off his legs by way of resting himself as of<br>
        removing his stilts. The shepherds, out all day tending their sheep,<br>
        might, if they pleased, stretch themselves at full length on the grey<br>
        sand, making a pillow of the low bushes. But they prefer to stand;<br>
        and you may see them, reclining against a third pole stuck in the<br>
        ground at the rear, contentedly knitting stockings, keeping the while<br>
        one eye upon the flock of sheep anxiously nibbling at the meagre grass.</p>
      <p class="main">Next to the shepherds, the most remarkable live stock in
        the Landes<br>
        are the sheep. Such a melancholy careworn flock! poor relations of<br>
        the plump Southdown that grazes on fat Sussex wolds. Long-legged,<br>
        scraggy-necked, anxious-eyed, the sheep of the Landes bear eloquent<br>
        testimony to the penury of the place and the difficulty of making both<br>
        ends meet--which in their case implies the burrowing of the nose in<br>
        tufts of sand-girt grass. To abide among such sheep through the long<br>
        day should be enough to make any man melancholy. But the peasant of<br>
        the Landes, who is used to his stilts, also grows accustomed to his<br>
        sheep, and they all live together more or less happily ever afterwards.</p>
      <p class="main">The Landes is quite a prosperous province to-day compared
        with what it<br>
        was in the time of Louis XVI. During the First Empire there was what<br>
        we would call a Minister of Woods and Forests named Bremontier. He<br>
        looked over the Landes and found it to be nothing more than a waste of<br>
        shifting sand. Rescued from the sea by a mere freak of nature, it might,<br>
        for all practical purposes, have been much more usefully employed if<br>
        covered a few fathoms deep with salt water. To M. Bremontier came the<br>
        happy idea of planting the waste land with fir trees. Nothing else<br>
        would grow, the fir tree might. And it did. To-day the vast extent of<br>
        the Landes is almost entirely covered with dark forests in perpetual<br>
        verdure.</p>
      <p class="main">These have transformed the district, adding not only to
        the improvement<br>
        of its sanitary condition, but creating a new source of wealth. Out of<br>
        the boundless vistas of fir trees there ever flows a constant stream of<br>
        resin, which brings in large revenues. Passing through the forest by<br>
        the railway line from La Mothe to Arcachon, one sees every tree marked<br>
        with a deep cut. It looks as if the woodman had been about, picking out<br>
        trees ready for the axe, and had come to the conclusion that they might<br>
        be cut down <span class="italic">en bloc</span>. But these marks are indications
        of the process<br>
        of milking the forests. It is a very simple affair, to which mankind<br>
        contributes a mere trifle. In order to get at the resin a piece of bark<br>
        is cut off from each tree. Out of the wound the resin flows, falling<br>
        into a hole dug in the ground at the roots. When this is full it is<br>
        emptied into cans and carried off to the big reservoir: when one wound<br>
        in the tree is healed another is cut above it, and so the tree is<br>
        finally drained.</p>
      <p class="main">Besides this revenue from resin immense sums are obtained
        from the sale<br>
        of timber; and thus the Landes, which a hundred years ago seemed to be<br>
        an inconvenient freak of nature afflicting complaining France, has been<br>
        turned into a money-yielding department.</p>
      <p class="main">The firs which fringe the seacoast by the long strip of
        land that lies<br>
        between the mouth of the Gironde and the town of Bayonne have much to<br>
        do with the prosperity of Arcachon. The salt lake, with its little<br>
        cluster of fishermen's cottages, lies within a couple of hours'<br>
        journey by rail from Bordeaux, a toiling, prosperous place, which,<br>
        seated on the broad Garonne, longed for the sea. Some one discovered<br>
        that there was excellent bathing at Arcachon, the bed of the salt<br>
        lake sloping gently upwards in smooth and level sands. Then the doctors<br>
        took note of the beneficial effects of the fir trees which environed<br>
        the place. The aromatic scent they distilled was declared to be good<br>
        for weak chests, and, almost by magic, Arcachon began to grow.</p>
      <p class="main">By swift degrees the little cluster of fishermen's cottages
        spread till<br>
        it became a town--of one street truly, but the street is a mile and a<br>
        half long, skirting the seashore and backed by the fir forests. Bordeaux<br>
        took Arcachon by storm. A railway was made, and all through the summer<br>
        months the population poured into the long street, filling it beyond<br>
        all moderate notions of capacity. The rush came so soon, and Arcachon<br>
        was built in such a hurry, that the houses have a casual appearance,<br>
        recalling the towns one comes upon in the Far West of America, which<br>
        yesterday were villages, and to-day have a town-hall, a bank, many<br>
        grog-shops, a church or two, and four or five daily newspapers.</p>
      <p class="main">A vast number of the dwellings are of the proportion of
        pill-boxes. Some<br>
        are literally composed of two closets, one called a bedroom and the<br>
        other a sitting-room; or, oftener still, both used as bedrooms. Others<br>
        are built in terraces a storey high and a few feet wide, with the name<br>
        of the proprietor painted over the liliputian trap-door that serves for<br>
        entrance hall. The idea is that you live at ease and in comfort at<br>
        Bordeaux, and just run down to Arcachon for a bath. There are no<br>
        bathing machines or tents; but all along the shore, in supplement of the<br>
        liliputian houses that serve a double debt to pay--being residences at<br>
        night and bathing-machines by day,--stand rows of sentry-boxes, whence<br>
        the bather emerges arrayed in more or less bewitching attire. The water<br>
        is very shallow, and enterprising persons of either sex spend hours of<br>
        the summer day in paddling about in their bathing costumes.</p>
      <p class="main">It is a pretty, lively scene. For background the long straggling
        town;<br>
        in the foreground the motley groups of bathers, the far-reaching smooth<br>
        surface of the lake; and, beyond, the broad Atlantic, thundering<br>
        impotently upon the barricade of sandhills that makes possible the<br>
        peace of Arcachon.</p>
      <p class="main">Like all watering-places, Arcachon lives two lives. In summer-time
        it<br>
        springs into active bustle, with house-room at a premium, and the shops<br>
        and streets filled with a gay crowd. It affects to have a winter season,<br>
        and is, indeed, ostentatiously divided into two localities, one called<br>
        the winter-town and the other the summer-town. The former is situated<br>
        on the higher ground at the back of the town, and consists of villa<br>
        residences built on plots reclaimed from the fir forest.</p>
      <p class="main">This is well enough in the winter-time, many English people
        flocking<br>
        thither attracted by the shelter and scent of the fir trees; but<br>
        Arcachon itself--the long unlovely street--is in the winter months<br>
        steeped in the depths of desolation. The shops are deserted, the<br>
        pill-boxes have their lids put on, and everywhere forlorn signs hang<br>
        forth announcing that here is a <span class="italic">maison</span> or
        an <span class="italic">appartement &agrave; louer</span>.</p>
      <p class="main">All through the winter months, shut up between sea and sand,
        Arcachon<br>
        is A Town to Let.</p>
      <p class="main">Deprived in the winter months of the flock of holiday makers,
        Arcachon<br>
        makes money in quite another way. Just as suddenly as it bloomed forth<br>
        a fashionable watering-place, it has grown into an oyster park of<br>
        world-wide renown. Last year the Arcachon oyster beds produced not<br>
        less than three hundred million oysters, the cultivators taking in<br>
        round figures a million francs. The oysters are distributed through<br>
        various markets, but the greatest customer is London, whither there<br>
        come every year fifty millions of the dainty bivalve.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;And what do they call your oysters in London?&quot;
        I asked M. Faure, the<br>
        energetic gentleman who has established this new trade between the<br>
        Gironde and the Thames.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;They call them 'Natives',&quot; he said, with a sly
        twinkle.</p>
      <p class="main">The Arcachon oyster, if properly packed, can live eight
        days out of the<br>
        water, a period more than sufficient to allow for its transit by the<br>
        weekly steamers that trade between Bordeaux and London. A vast quantity<br>
        go to Marenne in the Charente lnferieure, where they fatten more<br>
        successfully than in the salt lake, and acquire that green colour which<br>
        makes them so much esteemed and so costly in the restaurants at Paris.</p>
      <p class="main">Oysters have, probably since the time of the Deluge, congregated
        in the<br>
        Basin d'Arcachon; but it is only within the last thirty years the<br>
        industry has been developed and placed on a footing that made possible<br>
        the growth of today. Up to the year 1860 oysters were left to their own<br>
        sweet will in the matter of creating a bed. When they settled upon a<br>
        place it was diligently cultivated, but the lead was absolutely left to<br>
        the oyster. Dr. Lalanne, in the intervals of a large medical practice
        at<br>
        La Teste, a little place on the margin of the Basin, observed that<br>
        oysters were often found attached to a piece of a wreck floating in the<br>
        middle of the water far remote from the beds.</p>
      <p class="main">This led him to study more closely the reproductive habits
        of the<br>
        oyster. He discovered that the eggs after incubation remained suspended<br>
        in the water for a space of from three to five days. Thus, for some<br>
        time after the <span class="italic">frai </span>season, practically the
        whole of the water in the<br>
        Basin d'Arcachon was thick with oysters' eggs. Dr. Lalanne conceived<br>
        the idea of providing this vast wealth with other means of establishing<br>
        itself than were offered by a casual piece of wreck. What was wanted<br>
        was something to which the eggs, floating in the water, could attach<br>
        themselves, and remain till they were developed beyond the state of<br>
        <span class="italic">ova</span>. After various experiments Dr. Lalanne
        adapted to the purpose the<br>
        hollow roof tile in use everywhere in the South of France.</p>
      <p class="main">These are laid in blocks, each containing one hundred and
        twelve tiles,<br>
        enclosed in a wooden framework. In June, when the oysters lay their<br>
        eggs, these blocks of tiles are dropped into the water by the oyster<br>
        beds. The eggs floating about, find the crusty surface of the tiles a<br>
        convenient resting-place, and attach themselves by millions. Six months<br>
        later the tiles, being examined, are found to be covered by oysters<br>
        grown to the size of a silver sixpence. The tiles are taken up and the<br>
        little oysters scraped off, a process facilitated by the fact that the<br>
        tiles have in the first instance been coated with a solution of lime,<br>
        which rubs off, carrying the tender oyster with it.</p>
      <p class="main">The infant oysters are next placed in iron network cases,
        through which<br>
        the water freely passes, whilst the young things are protected from<br>
        crabs and other natural enemies. At the end of a year or eighteen<br>
        months, they have so far grown as to be trusted out on their own<br>
        account. They are accordingly strewn on the broad oyster beds, to fatten<br>
        for another year or eighteen months, when they are ready for the waiting<br>
        <span class="italic">gourmet</span>. Your oyster is fit to eat at eighteen
        months of age; but there<br>
        is more of it when it is three years old.</p>
      <p class="main">We sailed out from Arcachon across the lake to the oyster
        park. Here<br>
        the water is so shallow that the men who tend the beds walk about them<br>
        in waterproof boots coming up to their knees. This part of the bay is<br>
        dotted with boats with white canopies. Seen at anchor from Arcachon<br>
        they look like boats laid up for the winter season; but every one is<br>
        tenanted night and day. They are the homes of the guardians of the<br>
        oyster beds, who keep watch and ward through the long winter.</p>
      <p class="main">Even more disastrous than possible visits from a male poacher
        are the<br>
        incursions of a large flat sea-fish, known at Arcachon as the <span class="italic">th&eacute;re</span>,<br>
        with us the ray. This gentleman has a colossal appetite for oysters.<br>
        Scorning to deal with them by the dozen, he devours them by the<br>
        thousand, asking neither for the succulent lemon nor the grosser<br>
        addition of Chili vinegar. His action with the oyster is exceedingly<br>
        summary. He breaks the shell with a vigorous blow of his tail, and<br>
        gobbles up the contents. As it is stated by reputable authorities<br>
        that the <span class="italic">th&eacute;re</span> can dispose of 100,000
        oysters in a day, it is clear<br>
        that the tapping must be pretty persistent.</p>
      <p class="main">This selfish brute, regardless of the fact that we pay a
        minimum three<br>
        shillings a dozen for oysters in London, is happily circumvented by<br>
        an exceedingly simple device. Rowing about the oyster beds at Arcachon<br>
        one notices that they are fringed with small twigs of fir trees. The<br>
        natural supposition is that these are to mark the boundary of the<br>
        various oyster beds; but it is in truth designed to keep out the<br>
        <span class="italic">th&eacute;re</span>. This blundering fish, bearing
        down on the oyster bed in search<br>
        of luncheon, comes upon the palisade of loosely planted twigs. Nothing<br>
        in the world would be easier than for him to steer between the openings,<br>
        of which there are abundance. But though he has stomach enough for a<br>
        hundred thousand oysters, he has not brains enough to understand that<br>
        by a little manoeuvring he might get at his meal. Repelled by the open<br>
        network of twigs, he swims forlornly round and round the beds, so near<br>
        and yet so far, with what anguish of heart only the lover of oysters<br>
        can fathom.</p>
      <p class="main">The oyster beds at Arcachon belong to the State, and are
        leased to<br>
        private persons, the leading company, which has created the British<br>
        trade, having its headquarters at La Teste. The wholesale price of<br>
        oysters at Arcachon is from a sovereign to forty shillings a thousand,<br>
        according to size. In the long street they sell retail at from twopence<br>
        to eightpence a dozen, thus realising what seems to-day the hopeless<br>
        dream of the British oyster-eater.</p>

      <p class="boldleft"><a name="86"></a>CHAPTER IX.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">CHRISTMAS EVE AT WATTS'S.</p>
      <p class="main">Wandering out of the High Street, Rochester, on the afternoon
        before<br>
        Christmas Day, by a narrow passage to the left I came upon the old<br>
        Cathedral. The doors were open, and as they were the only doors in<br>
        Rochester open to me, except, perhaps, those of the tramp house at the<br>
        Union, I entered, and sat down as near as befitted my condition. The<br>
        afternoon service was going on, and even to tired limbs and an empty<br>
        stomach it was restful and soothing to hear the sweet voices of the<br>
        surpliced choristers, and the grand deep tones of the organ, echoing<br>
        through the fretted roof, and rolling round the long pillared aisles.<br>
        There were not ten people there besides myself, the clergy and the choir<br>
        forming the bulk of the assembly. As soon as the service had been gone<br>
        through, the clergy and the choir filed out, and the lay people one by<br>
        one departed.</p>
      <p class="main">I should have liked to sit where I was all night. It was
        at least warm<br>
        and sheltered, and I have slept on worse beds than may be made of half<br>
        a dozen Cathedral chairs. But presently the verger came round, and<br>
        perceiving at a glance that I was not a person likely to possess a<br>
        superfluous sixpence, asked me if I was going to sit there all night.<br>
        I said I was if he didn't mind; but he did, and there was nothing for<br>
        it but to clear out.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Haven't you got nowhere to go to?&quot; asked the
        man, as I moved slowly<br>
        off.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Nowhere in particular,&quot; I answered.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;That's a bad look-out for Christmas-eve. Why don't
        you go over to<br>
        Watts's?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What's Watts's?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;It's a house in High Street, where you'll get a good
        supper, a bed,<br>
        and a fourpenny-bit in the morning if you can show you'em an honest man,<br>
        and not a regular tramp. There's old Watts's muniment down by the side<br>
        of the choir. A reglar brick he was, who not only wrote beautiful hymns,<br>
        but gave away his money for the relief of the pore.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">My heart warmed to the good old Doctor whose hymns I had
        learnt in<br>
        my youth, little thinking that the day would come when I should be<br>
        thankful to him for more substantial nourishment. I had intended to<br>
        go in the ordinary way to get a night's lodging in the casual ward;<br>
        but Watts's was evidently a better game, and getting from the verger<br>
        minute directions how to proceed in order to gain admittance to<br>
        Watts's, I left the Cathedral.</p>
      <p class="main">The verger was not a bad-hearted fellow, I am sure, though
        he did speak<br>
        roughly to me at first. He seemed struck with the fact that a man not<br>
        too well clad, who had nowhere particular to sleep on the eve of<br>
        Christmas Day, could scarcely be expected to be &quot;merry.&quot; All
        the time<br>
        he was talking about Watts's he was fumbling in his waistcoat pocket,<br>
        and I know he was feeling if he had there a threepenny-bit. But if he<br>
        had, it didn't come immediately handy, and before he got hold of it<br>
        the thought of the sufficient provision which awaited me at Watts's<br>
        afforded vicarious satisfaction to his charitable feelings, and he<br>
        was content with bidding me a kindly good-night, as he pointed my road<br>
        down the lane to the police-office, where, it seemed, Dr. Watts's guests<br>
        had to put in a preliminary appearance.</p>
      <p class="main">Crossing High Street, passing through a sort of courtyard,
        and down some<br>
        steps, I reached a snug-looking house, which I had some difficulty in<br>
        believing was a police-office. But it was, and the first thing I saw was<br>
        seven men lounging about the yard. They didn't seem like regular tramps,<br>
        but they had a look as if they had walked far, and each man carried a<br>
        little bundle and a stick. The verger had told me that only six men per<br>
        night were admitted to Watts's, and there were seven already.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Are you for Watts's?&quot; one of them, a little,
        sharp-looking fellow, with<br>
        short light hair pasted down over his forehead, asked me, seeing me<br>
        hesitate.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Well, it ain't no go to-night. There's seven here,
        and fust come,<br>
        fust served.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Don't believe him, young 'un,&quot; said an elderly
        man, &quot;it's all one what<br>
        time you come, so as it's afore half-past five you'll take your chance<br>
        with the rest of us.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">It was not yet five, so I loafed about with the rest of
        them, being<br>
        scowled upon by all except the elderly man till the arrival of two other<br>
        travellers removed to them the weight of the odium I had lightly borne.<br>
        At a quarter to six a police-sergeant appeared at the door of the office<br>
        and said:</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Now then.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This was generally interpreted as a signal to advance, and
        we stood<br>
        forward in an irregular line. The sergeant looked around us sternly<br>
        till his eye lighted upon the elderly man.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;So you're trying it on again, are you?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I've not been here for two months, if I may never
        sleep in a bed<br>
        again,&quot; whimpered the elderly man.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;You was here last Monday week that I know of, and
        may be since. Off you<br>
        go!&quot; and the elderly gentleman went off with an alacrity that rather<br>
        reduced the wonderment I had felt at his disinterested intervention to<br>
        prevent my losing a chance, suggesting, as it did, that he felt the<br>
        probability of gaining admission was exceedingly remote.</p>
      <p class="main">I was the next upon whom the eye of the police-sergeant
        loweringly fell.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;A night's lodging at Watts's.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Watts's is for decent workmen on the tramp. You ain't
        a labourer. Show<br>
        me your hands.&quot; I held out my hands, and the police-sergeant examined<br>
        the palms critically.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What are you?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;A paper stainer.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Where have you been to?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I came from Canterbury last.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Where do you work?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;In London when I can find work.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Where are you going now?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;To London.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;How much money have you got?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Three-halfpence.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Humph!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I don't know whether a murder had recently been committed
        in Kent, and<br>
        whether I in some degree answered to the description of the supposed<br>
        murderer. If it were so, the unfortunate circumstance will explain why<br>
        the sergeant should have run me through and through with his eyes whilst<br>
        propounding these queries, and why he should have made them in such a<br>
        gruff voice. However, he seemed to have finally arrived at the<br>
        conclusion that I was not the person wanted for the murder, and after
        a<br>
        brief pause he said, &quot;Go inside.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I went inside, into one of the snuggest little police-offices
        I have<br>
        seen in the course of some tramping, and took the liberty of warming<br>
        myself by the cosy fire, whilst the remaining applicants for admission<br>
        to Watts's were being put through a sort of minor catechism such as that<br>
        I had survived. Presently the sergeant came in with the selected five
        of<br>
        my yard companions, and, taking us one by one, entered in a book, under<br>
        the date &quot;24th December,&quot; our several names, ages, birthplaces
        and<br>
        occupations, also the names of the last place we had come from, and the<br>
        next whither we were going. Then, taking up a scrap of blue paper with<br>
        some printed words on it, and filling in figures, a date, and a<br>
        signature, he bade us follow him.</p>
      <p class="main">Out of the snug police-office--which put utterly in the
        shade the<br>
        comforts of the cathedral regarded as a sleeping place--across the<br>
        courtyard, which somebody said faced the Sessions House, down High<br>
        Street to the left till we stopped before an old-fashioned white house<br>
        with a projecting lamp lit above the doorway, shining full on an<br>
        inscription graven in stone. I read it then and copied it when I left<br>
        the house next morning. It ran thus:--</p>

      <p class="smallquote">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="main">It was not Dr. Watts, then, as the verger had given me to
        understand. I<br>
        was sorry, for it had seemed like going to the house of an old friend,<br>
        and I had meant after supper to recite &quot;How doth the little Busy
        Bee&quot;<br>
        for the edification of my fellow-guests, and to tell them what I had<br>
        learnt long ago of the good writer's life and labours.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Here we are again, Mrs. Kercham,&quot; said our conductor,
        stepping into the<br>
        low hall of the white house.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes, here you are again,&quot; replied an old lady,
        dressed in black, and<br>
        wearing a widow's cap. &quot;Have you got 'em all to-night?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes, six--all tidy men. Can you write, Mr. Paper Stainer?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I could write, and did, setting forth, in a book which lay
        on a table in<br>
        a room labelled &quot;Office,&quot; my name, age, occupation, and the
        town whence<br>
        I had last come. Three of the other guests followed my example. Two<br>
        could not write; and the sergeant, paying me a compliment on my<br>
        beautiful clerkly handwriting, asked me to fill in the particulars for<br>
        them. This ceremony over, we were shown into our bedrooms, and told to<br>
        give ourselves &quot;a good wash.&quot; My room was on the ground-floor,
        out in<br>
        the yard: and I hope I may never be shown into a worse. It was not<br>
        large, being about eight feet square, nor was it very high. The walls<br>
        were whitewashed, and the floor clean. A single small window, deep set<br>
        in the thick stone-built walls, looked out on to the yard, and by it<br>
        stood the solitary piece of furniture, a somewhat rickety Windsor chair.<br>
        I except the bed, which was supposed to stand in a corner, but actually<br>
        covered nearly the whole of the floor. The bedstead was of iron, and,
        I<br>
        should imagine, was one of the earliest constructions of the sort ever<br>
        sold in this country.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I put on three blankets, being Christmas-time, though
        the weather is<br>
        not according; so you can take one off if you like.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Thank you, ma'am; I'll leave it till I go to bed,
        if you please.&quot; Much<br>
        reason had I subsequently to be thankful for my caution.</p>
      <p class="main">After having washed, I came out, and was told to go into
        a room, facing<br>
        my bedroom, on the other side of the yard. Here I found three of my<br>
        fellow-guests sitting by a fire, and in a few minutes the other two<br>
        arrived, all looking very clean and (speaking for myself particularly)<br>
        feeling ravenously hungry. The chamber, which had &quot;Travellers' Room&quot;<br>
        painted over the doorway, was about twelve or thirteen feet long and<br>
        eight wide, and, like our bedrooms, was not remarkable for variety of<br>
        furniture. A plain deal table stood at one end, and then there were<br>
        two benches, and that's all. Over the mantelpiece a large card hung<br>
        with the following inscription:--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Persons accepting this charity are each supplied with
        a supper,<br>
        consisting of half a pound of meat, one pound of bread, and half a pint<br>
        of porter at seven o'clock in the evening, and fourpence on leaving the<br>
        house in the morning. The additional comfort of a good fire is given<br>
        during the winter months, from October 18th till March 10th, for the<br>
        purpose of drying their clothes and supplying hot water for their use.<br>
        They go to bed at eight o'clock.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This was satisfactory, except inasmuch as it appeared that
        supper was<br>
        not to be forthcoming till seven o'clock, and it was now only twenty<br>
        minutes past six. This forty minutes promised to be harder to bear<br>
        than the hunger of the long day; but the pain was averted by the<br>
        appearance at half-past six of a pleasant-looking young woman,<br>
        carrying a plate of cold roast beef in each hand. These she put down<br>
        on the table, supplementing them in course of time with four similar<br>
        plates, six small loaves, and as many mugs of porter.</p>
      <p class="main">It does not become guests to dictate arrangements, but if
        the worshipful<br>
        trustees of Watts's knew how tantalising it is to a hungry man to see<br>
        cold roast beef brought in in a slow and deliberate manner, they would<br>
        buy a large tray for the use of the pleasant young person, and let the<br>
        feast burst at once upon the vision of the guests.</p>
      <p class="main">Sharp on the stroke of seven we drew the benches up to the
        table, and<br>
        Mrs. Kercham, standing at one end and leaning over, said grace.<br>
        Impatiently hungry as I was, I could not help noticing the precise<br>
        terms in which the good matron implored a blessing. I suppose she had<br>
        had her tea in the parlour. At any rate, she was not going to favour<br>
        us with her company, and so, bending over our plates of cold beef, she<br>
        lifted up her voice and said with emphasis,--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;For what <span class="italic">you</span> are about
        to receive out of His bountiful goodness may<br>
        the Lord make you truly thankful.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I write the personal pronoun with a capital letter, not
        being quite<br>
        certain from Mrs. Kercham's rapid enunciation whether the bountiful<br>
        goodness was Mr. Watts's or the Lord's.</p>
      <p class="main">Six emphatic &quot;Amens!&quot; followed, and before the
        sound had died away<br>
        six able-bodied men had fallen-to upon the beef and the bread in a<br>
        manner that would have done kind Master Watts's heart good had he<br>
        beheld them.</p>
      <p class="main">I think I had done first, for I remember when I looked round
        the table<br>
        my fellow-guests were still eating and washing their suppers down with<br>
        economical draughts from the half-pint mugs of porter. They--I think I<br>
        may say we--did credit to the selection of the police sergeant, and, so<br>
        far as appearances went, fulfilled one of the requirements of Master<br>
        Watts, there being nothing of the rogue in our faces, if I except a<br>
        slight hint in the physiognomy of the little man with the fair hair<br>
        plastered down over his forehead, and perhaps I am prejudiced against<br>
        him.</p>
      <p class="main">It was a little after seven when the plates were all polished,
        the mugs<br>
        drained, and nothing but a few crumbs left to tell where a loaf had<br>
        stood. The pleasant young person coming in to clear the table, we drew<br>
        up round the fire, and for the first time in our more than two hours'<br>
        companionship began to exchange remarks.</p>
      <p class="main">They were of the briefest and most commonplace character,
        and attempts<br>
        made to get up a general conversation signally failed. &quot;What do you<br>
        do?&quot; &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; &quot;Things hard down there?&quot;
        were staple<br>
        questions, with an occasional &quot;Did you hear tell of Joe Mackin on
        the<br>
        road?&quot; or &quot;Was Bill O'Brien there at the time?&quot; From the
        replies to these<br>
        inquiries I learnt that my companions were respectively a fitter, a<br>
        painter, a waiter, and two indefinitely self-described as &quot;labourers.&quot;<br>
        They had walked since morning from Faversham, from Sittingbourne, from<br>
        Gravesend, and from Greenwich, and, sitting close around the fire,<br>
        soon began to testify to their weariness by nodding, and even snoring.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Well, lads, I'm off, goodnight,&quot; said the painter,
        yawning and<br>
        stretching himself out of the room.</p>
      <p class="main">One by one the remaining four quickly followed, and before
        what I had<br>
        on entering regarded as the absurdly early hour of eight o'clock had<br>
        struck, five of Watts's guests had gone to bed, and the sixth was<br>
        sitting looking drowsily in the fire, and thinking what a jolly<br>
        Christmas he was having.</p>
      <p class="main">I was awakened by a familiar voice inquiring whether I was
        &quot;going to<br>
        sit up all night,&quot; and opening my eyes beheld the matron standing
        by me<br>
        with a shovelful of coal in one hand and a small jug in the other. Her<br>
        voice was sharp, but her look was kind, and I was not a bit surprised<br>
        when she threw the coal on the fire, and, putting down the jug, which<br>
        evidently contained porter, said she would bring a glass in a minute.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I'm not going to bed myself for a bit, and if you
        like to sit by the<br>
        fire and smoke a pipe and drink a glass whilst I mend a stocking or<br>
        two, you'll be company.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">So we sat together by Master Watts's fire, and whilst I
        drank his<br>
        porter and smoked my own tobacco, the matron mended her stockings, and<br>
        told me a good deal about the trials she had gone through in a life<br>
        that would never again see its sixtieth year. Forty years she had<br>
        spent under the roof of Watts's, and knew all about the old man's<br>
        will, and how he ordered that after the re-marriage or the death of<br>
        his wife, his principal dwelling-house, called Satis, on Boley Hill,<br>
        with the house adjoining, the closes, orchards, and appurtenances,<br>
        his plate and his furniture, should be sold, and the proceeds be<br>
        placed out at usury by the Mayor and citizens of Rochester for the<br>
        perpetual support of an alms-house then erected and standing near<br>
        the Market Cross; and how he further ordained that there should be<br>
        added thereto six rooms, &quot;with a chimney in each,&quot; and with<br>
        convenient places for six good mattresses or flock beds, and other<br>
        good and sufficient furniture for the lodgment of poor wayfarers<br>
        for a single night.</p>
      <p class="main">Had she many people come to see the quaint old place beside
        those<br>
        whom the police-sergeant brought every night?</p>
      <p class="main">Not many. The visitors' book had been twenty years in the
        house,<br>
        and it was not nearly full of names.</p>
      <p class="main">I took up the book, and carelessly turning back the leaves
        came upon<br>
        the signature &quot;Charles Dickens,&quot; with &quot;Mark Lemon&quot;
        written underneath.</p>
      <p class="main">I know Dickens pretty well--his books, I mean, of course--and
        said,<br>
        with a gratified start, &quot;Ha! has Dickens been here?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes, he has,&quot; said the matron, in her sharpest
        tones, &quot;and a pretty<br>
        pack of lies he told about it. Stop a bit.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I stopped accordingly whilst the old lady flew out of the
        room, and<br>
        flying back again with a well-worn pamphlet in her hand, shoved it at<br>
        me, saying, &quot;Read that.&quot; I opened it, and found it to be the
        Christmas<br>
        number of <span class="italic">Household Words</span> for 1854. It was
        entitled &quot;The Seven Poor<br>
        Travellers,&quot; and the opening chapter, in Mr Dickens's well-known
        style,<br>
        described by name, and in detail, the very house in which I had taken<br>
        my supper.</p>
      <p class="main">It was a charming narrative, I, poor waif and stray, felt
        a strong<br>
        personal regard for the great novelist as I read the cheery story in<br>
        which he sets forth how, calling at the house on the afternoon before<br>
        Christmas-day, he obtained permission to give a Christmas feast to the<br>
        six Poor Travellers; how he ordered the materials for the feast to be<br>
        sent in from his own inn; how, when the feast was set upon the table,<br>
        &quot;finer beef, a finer turkey, a greater prodigality of sauce and gravy,&quot;<br>
        he never saw; and how &quot;it made my heart rejoice to see the wonderful<br>
        justice my travellers did to everything set before them.&quot; All this
        and<br>
        much more, including &quot;a jug of wassail&quot; and the &quot;hot plum-pudding
        and<br>
        mince pies,&quot; which &quot;a wall-eyed young man connected with the
        fly<br>
        department at the hotel was, at a given signal, to dash into the<br>
        kitchen, seize, and speed with to Dr. Watts's Charity,&quot; was painted<br>
        with a warmth and colour that made my mouth water, even after the plate<br>
        of cold beef, the small loaf, and the unaccustomed allowance of porter.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;How like Dickens!&quot; I exclaimed, with wet eyes,
        as I finished the<br>
        recital; &quot;and he even waited in Rochester all night to give his poor<br>
        Travellers 'hot coffee and piles of bread and butter in the morning!'&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Get along with you! he didn't do nothing of the sort.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What! didn't he come here, as he says, and give the
        poor Travellers a<br>
        Christmas treat?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Not a bit of it; as the matron, with indignation that seemed
        to have<br>
        lost nothing by lapse of years, forthwith demonstrated. There had been<br>
        no supper, no wassail, no hot coffee in the morning, and, in truth, no<br>
        meeting between Charles Dickens and the Travellers, at Christmas or at<br>
        any other time.</p>
      <p class="main">Indeed, the visitors' book testified that the visit had
        been paid on<br>
        May 11th, 1854, and not at Christmastide at all.</p>
      <p class="main">It was time to go to bed after that, and I left the matron
        to cool down<br>
        from the boiling-point to which she had been suddenly lifted at sight<br>
        of the ghost of 1854. My little room looked cheerless enough in the<br>
        candlelight, but I had brought sleep with me as a companion, and knew<br>
        that I should soon be as happy as if my bed were of down, and the<br>
        roof-tree that of Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p class="main">And so in sooth I would have been but for the chimney. Why
        did the<br>
        otherwise unexceptional Master Watts insist upon the chimney? Such a<br>
        chimney it was, too, yawning across the full length of one side of the<br>
        room, and open straight up to the cold sky. There was--what I forgot<br>
        to mention in the inventory--a sort of tall clothes-horse standing<br>
        before the enormous aperture, and after trying various devices to keep<br>
        the wind out, I at last bethought me of the supernumerary blanket, and,<br>
        throwing it over the clothes-horse, I leaned it against the chimney<br>
        board. This served admirably as long as it kept its feet, and when it<br>
        blew down, as it did occasionally during the night, it only meant<br>
        putting up and refixing it, and the exercise prevented heavy sleeping.</p>
      <p class="main">At seven in the morning we were called up, and after another
        &quot;good<br>
        wash,&quot; went our ways, each with fourpence sterling in his hand, the<br>
        parting gift of hospitable Master Watts.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Good-bye, paper-stainer,&quot; said the matron, as,
        after looking up and<br>
        down High Street, I strode off towards the bridge, Londonwards. &quot;Come<br>
        and see us again if you are passing this way.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Thank you,--I will,&quot; I said.</p>
      <p class="main"><br>
        <span class="boldleft"><a name="100"></a>CHAPTER X.</span></p>
      <p class="boldleft">NIGHT AND DAY ON THE CARS IN CANADA.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Porter!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The voice broke the stillness of a long night, and suddenly
        woke me out<br>
        of a deep sleep. There was a moment's pause, and then the voice, which<br>
        sounded singularly near to my bed-curtains, spoke again.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Porter!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes, sah!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;You have given me the wrong boots.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">From the foot of my bed, as it seemed, there came another
        voice which<br>
        said, with querulous emphasis, &quot;These are not my boots.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Then followed explanations, apologies, and interchange of
        boots; and<br>
        before the parleying had come to an end I was sufficiently awake to<br>
        remember that on the previous night I had gone to bed in a Pullman car<br>
        at Montreal, and had been speeding all night towards Halifax. It had<br>
        been mild autumnal weather in Montreal, and the snow, which a week ago<br>
        had fallen to the depth of two or three inches, had melted and been<br>
        trodden out of sight save for the sprinkling which remained on the<br>
        crest of Mount Royal. Here, as a glance through the window disclosed,<br>
        we were again in the land of snow. It was not deep, for winter had not<br>
        yet set in, and the sleighs, joyfully brought out at the first fall,<br>
        had been relegated to summer quarters. But there was quite enough about<br>
        to give the country a cheerful wintry aspect, the morning sun shining<br>
        merrily over the white fields and the leafless trees, bare save for the<br>
        foliage with which the snowflakes had endowed them. It may have been an<br>
        equally fine morning in Montreal, but it is certain it seemed twice as<br>
        bright and fresh here, and we began to realise something of those<br>
        exhilarating properties of the Canadian air of which we had fondly read.</p>
      <p class="main">On this long journey eastward travellers do not enter the
        city of<br>
        Quebec. They pass by on the other side of the river, and thus gain the<br>
        advantage of seeing Quebec as a picture should be seen, from a<br>
        convenient distance. Moreover, like many celebrated paintings, Quebec<br>
        will not stand inspection at the length of the nose. But even taken in<br>
        detail, walking through its narrow and steep streets, there is much to<br>
        delight the eye. It has quaint old houses, and shops with pea green<br>
        shutters, over which flaunt crazy, large-lettered signs that it could<br>
        have entered into the heart of none but a Frenchman to devise. Save for<br>
        the absence of the blouse and the sabot you might, picking your way<br>
        through the mud in a street in the lower part of the city, imagine<br>
        yourself in some quarters of Dieppe or Calais, or any other of the<br>
        busier towns in the north of France. The peaked roofs, the unexpected<br>
        balconies, the ill-regulated gables, and the general individuality of<br>
        the houses are pleasing to the eye wearied with the prim monotony of<br>
        English street architecture.</p>
      <p class="main">Quebec, to be seen at its best, should be gazed at from
        the harbour, or<br>
        from the other side of the river. This morning it is glorious, with its<br>
        streets in the snow, its many spires in the sunlight, and the blue haze<br>
        of the hills in the distance. We make our first stoppage at Point Levi,<br>
        the station for Quebec, and here are twenty minutes for breakfast. The<br>
        whereabouts of breakfast is indicated by a youth, who from the steps of<br>
        an &quot;hotel&quot; at the station gate stolidly rings a bell. The passengers<br>
        enter, and are shown into a room, in the centre of which is a large<br>
        stove. The atmosphere is simply horrible. The double windows are up for<br>
        the still dallying winter, and, as the drops of dirty moisture which<br>
        stand on the panes testify, they are hermetically closed. The kitchen<br>
        leads out of the room by what is apparently the only open door in the<br>
        house, every other being jealously closed lest peradventure a whiff of<br>
        fresh air should get in. It is impossible to eat, and one is glad to<br>
        pay for the untasted food and get out into the open air before the<br>
        power of respiration is permanently injured.</p>
      <p class="main">It was said this is the only place where there would be
        any chance of<br>
        breakfast, nothing to eat till Trois Pistoles is reached, late in the<br>
        afternoon. Happily this information turned out ill-founded. At L'Islet,<br>
        a little station reached at eleven o'clock a stoppage was made at an<br>
        unpretentious but clean and fresh restaurant, where the people speak<br>
        French and know how to make soup.</p>
      <p class="main">A few years ago a journey by rail between Montreal and Halifax,
        without<br>
        break save what is necessary for replenishing the engine stores, would<br>
        have been impossible. The Grand Trunk, spanning the breadth of the more<br>
        favoured provinces of Ontario and Quebec, leaves New Brunswick and Nova<br>
        Scotia without other means of intercommunication than is afforded by its<br>
        many rivers and its questionable roads. For many years Canadian<br>
        statesmen, and all others interested in the practical confederation of<br>
        the various provinces that make up the Dominion, felt that the primary<br>
        and surest bond of union would be a railway. The military authorities<br>
        were even more urgent as to the necessity of connecting Quebec and<br>
        Halifax, and at one time a military road was seriously talked about.<br>
        Long ago a railway was projected, and in 1846-8 a survey was carried out<br>
        with that object. From that date up to 1869, when the road was actually<br>
        commenced, the matter was fitfully discussed, and it was only in 1876<br>
        that the railway was opened.</p>
      <p class="main">It is only a single line, and as a commercial undertaking
        is not likely<br>
        to pay at that, passing as it does through long miles of territory where<br>
        &quot;still stands the forest primeval.&quot; It was made by the Dominion<br>
        Government in pursuance of a high national policy, and it adequately and<br>
        admirably meets the ends for which it was devised. The total length from<br>
        Rivi&egrave;re du Loup to Halifax is 561 miles. There is a spur running
        down to<br>
        St. John, in the Bay of Fundy, eighty-nine miles long, another branch<br>
        fifty-two miles long to Pictou, a great coal district opposite the<br>
        southern end of Prince Edward Island; while a third span of eleven<br>
        miles, branching off at Monckton and finishing at Point du Char, meets<br>
        the steamers for Prince Edward Island, making a total length of 713<br>
        miles. The rails are steel, and the road is, mile for mile, as well made<br>
        as any in England. The carriages are on the American principle--the long<br>
        waggons capable of seating fifty or sixty persons, with an open passage<br>
        down the centre, through which the conductor and ticket collector<br>
        periodically walk. The carriages are heated to distraction by means of
        a<br>
        huge stove at either end. It is possible to open the windows, but that<br>
        is to be easily accomplished only after an apprenticeship too long for<br>
        the stay of the average traveller. After a painful hour one gets<br>
        accustomed to the atmosphere of the place, as it is happily possible to<br>
        grow accustomed to any atmosphere. But the effect of these fierce stoves<br>
        and obstinate windows must be permanently deleterious.</p>
      <p class="main">The Pullman car has fortunately come to make railway travelling
        in<br>
        America endurable. Apart from other considerations, the inevitable stove<br>
        is better managed. You are thoroughly warmed,---occasionally, it is<br>
        true, parboiled. But there is at least freedom from the sulphurous<br>
        atmosphere which pervades the ordinary car, with its two infernal<br>
        machines, one at either end. In addition, the Pullman cars have more<br>
        luxurious fittings, and are hung on smoother springs. It is at night<br>
        their value becomes higher, and travellers are inclined to lie awake and<br>
        wonder how their fathers and elder brothers managed to travel in the<br>
        pre-Pullman era.</p>
      <p class="main">Life is too short to limit travel on this continent to the
        daytime.<br>
        Travelling eight hours a day by rail, which we in England think a pretty<br>
        good allowance, it would take just five days to go from Montreal to<br>
        Halifax. Thanks to the Pullman car and its adequate sleeping<br>
        accommodation, a business man may leave Montreal at ten o'clock at<br>
        night, say on Monday, and be in Halifax in time to transact business<br>
        shortly after noon on Wednesday. Thus he loses only a day, for he must<br>
        sleep somewhere, and he might find many a worse bed than is made up for<br>
        him on a Pullman. The arrangements for ventilation leave nothing to be<br>
        desired save a little less apprehension on the part of Canadians of the<br>
        supposed malign influence of fresh air. If you can get the ventilators<br>
        kept open you may sleep with impunity. But, as far as a desire for<br>
        preserving the goodwill of my immediate neighbours controls me, I would,<br>
        being in Canada, as soon pick a pocket as open a window. One night,<br>
        before the beds were made up I secretly approached the coloured<br>
        gentleman in charge of the carriage and heavily bribed him to open the<br>
        ventilators. This he faithfully did, as I saw, but when I awoke this<br>
        morning, half stifled in the heavy atmosphere, I found every ventilator<br>
        closed.</p>
      <p class="main">After leaving Quebec, and for a far-reaching run, the railway
        skirts the<br>
        river St. Lawrence, of which we get glimpses near and far as we pass.<br>
        The time is not far distant when this mighty river will be frozen to the<br>
        distance of fully a mile out, and men may skate where Atlantic steamers<br>
        sail. At present the river is free, but the frost comes like a thief in<br>
        the night, and the wary shipmasters have already gone into winter<br>
        quarters. The railway people are also preparing for the too familiar<br>
        terrors of the Canadian winter. As we steamed out of Quebec we saw the<br>
        snow-ploughs conveniently shunted, ready for use at a moment's notice.<br>
        The snowsheds are a permanent institution on the Intercolonial Railway.<br>
        The train passes through them sometimes for the length of half a mile.<br>
        They are simply wooden erections like a box, built in parts of the line<br>
        where the snow is likely to drift. Passing swiftly through them just now<br>
        you catch glimmers of light through the crevices. Presently, when the<br>
        snow comes, these will be effectually closed up. Snow will lie a hundred<br>
        feet thick on either side, to the full height of the shed, and the<br>
        train, as watched from the line, will seem to vanish in an illimitable<br>
        snow mound.</p>
      <p class="main">This is as yet in the future. At present the landscape has
        all the<br>
        beauty that snow can give without the monotony of the unrelieved waste<br>
        of white. Mounds of brown earth, tufts of grass, bits of road, roofs of<br>
        houses, and belts of pine showing above the sprinkling of snow, give<br>
        colour to the landscape. One divines already why Canadians, in building<br>
        their houses, paint a door, or a side of a chimney, or a gable-end, red<br>
        or chocolate, whilst all the rest is white. This looks strange in the<br>
        summer, or in the bleak interregnum when neither the sun nor the<br>
        north-east wind can be said absolutely to reign. But in the winter, when<br>
        far as the eye can roam it is wearied with sight of the everlasting<br>
        snow, a patch of red or of warm brown on the scarcely less white houses<br>
        is a surprising relief.</p>
      <p class="main">The country in the neighbourhood of Rivi&egrave;re du Loup,
        where the Grand<br>
        Trunk finishes and the Intercolonial begins, is filled with comfortable<br>
        homesteads. The line runs through a valley between two ranges of hills.<br>
        All about the slopes on the river side stand snug little houses, each<br>
        within its own grounds, each having a peaked roof, which strives more
        or<br>
        less effectually to rival the steepness of its neighbour. The houses<br>
        straggle for miles down the line, as if they had started out from Quebec<br>
        with the intention of founding a town for themselves, and had stopped
        on<br>
        the way, beguiled by the beauty of the situation. Sometimes a little<br>
        group stand together, when be sure you shall find a church, curiously<br>
        small but exceedingly ornate in its architecture. The spires are coated<br>
        with a glazed tile, which catches whatever sunlight there may be about,<br>
        and glistens strangely in the landscape.</p>
      <p class="main">The first day following the first night of our journey closed
        in a<br>
        manner befitting its rare beauty. The sun went down amid a glow of<br>
        grandeur that illuminated all the world to the west, transfigured the<br>
        blue mountains veined with snow, and spread a soft roseate blush over<br>
        the white lowlands. We went to bed in New Brunswick still in the hilly<br>
        country named by the colonists Northumberland. We awoke to find<br>
        ourselves in the narrow neck of land which connects Nova Scotia with the<br>
        continent. It was like going to bed in Sweden in December, and waking
        in<br>
        Ireland in September. The snow was melted, the sun was hidden behind the<br>
        one thin cloud that spread from horizon to horizon, and the sharp, brisk<br>
        air of yesterday was exchanged for a cold, wet atmosphere, that<br>
        distilled itself in dank drops on the window-panes. The aspect of the<br>
        country was also changed. The ground was sodden, the grass brown with<br>
        perpetual wet. In one field we saw the hapless haycocks floating in<br>
        water. Thus it was through Nova Scotia into Halifax--water everywhere
        on<br>
        the ground, and threatening rain in the air.</p>
      <p class="main"><br>
        <span class="boldleft"><a name="108"></a>CHAPTER XI</span></p>
      <p class="boldleft">EASTER ON LES AVANTS.</p>
      <p class="main">We nearly lost our Naturalist between Paris and Lausanne.
        It was felt at<br>
        the time, more especially by the latest additions to the party, that<br>
        this would have been a great calamity. Habits, long acquired, of<br>
        stopping by the roadside and minutely examining weeds or bits of stone,<br>
        are not to be eradicated in a night's journey by rail. Accordingly,<br>
        wherever the train stopped the Naturalist was, at the last moment,<br>
        discovered to be absent, and search parties were organised with a<br>
        promptness that, before we reached Dijon, had become quite creditable.<br>
        But the success achieved begat a condition of confidence that nearly<br>
        proved fatal. In travelling on a French line there is only one thing<br>
        more remarkable than the leisurely way in which an express train gets<br>
        under way after having stopped at a station, and that is the excitement<br>
        that pervades the neighbourhood ten minutes before the train starts. Men<br>
        in uniform go about shrieking <span class="italic">&quot;En voiture, messieurs,
        en voiture!&quot;</span> in a<br>
        manner that suggests to the English traveller that the train is actually<br>
        in motion, and that his passage is all but lost.</p>
      <p class="main">It was this habitude that led to our excitement at Melun.
        We had, after<br>
        superhuman efforts, got the Naturalist into the carriage, and had<br>
        breathlessly fallen back in the seat, expecting the train to move<br>
        forthwith. Ten minutes later it slowly steamed out of the station,<br>
        accompanied by the sound of the tootling horn and enveloped in thick<br>
        clouds of poisonous smoke. This sort of thing happening at one or two<br>
        other stations, we were induced to give our Naturalist an extra five<br>
        minutes to gather some fresh specimen of a rare grass growing between<br>
        the rails or some curious insect embedded in the bookstall. It was at<br>
        Sens that, growing bolder with success, we nearly did lose him,<br>
        dragging him in at the last moment, amid a scene of excitement that<br>
        could be equalled elsewhere only on the supposition that the station<br>
        was on fire and that five kegs of gunpowder were in the booking-office.</p>
      <p class="main">Shortly after leaving Dijon a conviction began to spread
        that perhaps if<br>
        the fates had proved adverse, and we had lost him somewhere under<br>
        circumstances that would have permitted him to come on by a morning<br>
        train, we might have borne up against the calamity. Amongst a<br>
        miscellaneous and imposing collection of scientific instruments, he was<br>
        the pleased possessor of an aneroid. This I am sure is an excellent and<br>
        even indispensable instrument at certain crises. But when you have been<br>
        so lucky as to get to sleep in a railway carriage on a long night<br>
        journey, to be awakened every quarter of an hour to be informed &quot;how<br>
        high you are now&quot; grows wearisome before morning.</p>
      <p class="main">It was the Chancery Barrister who was partly responsible
        for this. He<br>
        found it impossible to sleep, and our Naturalist, fastening upon him,<br>
        kept him carefully posted up in particulars of the increasing altitude.<br>
        This was the kind of thing that broke in upon our slumbers all through<br>
        the night:--</p>
      <p class="main">Our Naturalist: &quot;1200 feet above the level of the sea.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The Chancery Barrister (in provokingly sleepy tone): &quot;Ah!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Then we turn over, and fall asleep again. A quarter of an
        hour later:</p>
      <p class="main">Our Naturalist: &quot;1500 feet now.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Chancery Barrister: &quot;Really!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Another fitful slumber, broken by a strong presentiment
        that the<br>
        demoniacal aneroid is being again produced.</p>
      <p class="main">Our Naturalist (exultantly, as if he had privately arranged
        the incline,<br>
        and was justly boastful of his success): &quot;2100 feet.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Chancery Barrister (evidently feeling that something extra
        is expected of<br>
        him): &quot;No, <span class="italic">really</span> now!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This kind of thing through what should be the silent watches
        of the<br>
        night is to be deprecated, as tending to bring science into disrepute.</p>
      <p class="main">There was a good deal of excitement about the baggage. We
        were a<br>
        personally conducted party to the extent that the Hon. Member who had<br>
        suggested the trip, had undertaken the general direction, or had had<br>
        the office thrust upon him. Feeling his responsibility, he had,<br>
        immediately on arriving at Calais, changed some English money. This<br>
        was found very convenient. Nobody had any francs except the Member, so<br>
        we freely borrowed from him to meet trifling exigencies.</p>
      <p class="main">With the object of arriving at the best possible means of
        dealing with<br>
        the vexed question of luggage, a variety of expedients had been tried.<br>
        The Chancery Barrister, having read many moving narratives of raids made<br>
        upon registered luggage in the secrecy of the luggage van, had adopted
        a<br>
        course which displayed a profound knowledge of human nature. He had<br>
        argued with himself (as if he were a judge in chambers) that what proved<br>
        an irresistible temptation to foreign guards and other railway officials<br>
        was the appearance of boxes and portmanteaux iron-clasped,<br>
        leather-strapped, and double-locked. The inference naturally was that<br>
        they contained much that was valuable. Now, he had pointed out to<br>
        himself, if you take a directly opposite course, and, as it were, invite<br>
        the gentleman in charge of your luggage to open your portmanteau, he<br>
        will think you have nothing in it worth his attention, and will pass on<br>
        to others more jealously guarded. You can't very well leave your box<br>
        open, as the things might tumble out. So, as a happy compromise, he had<br>
        duly locked and strapped his portmanteau, and then tied the key to the<br>
        handle.</p>
      <p class="main">As he observes, with the shrewd perception that will inevitably
        lead him<br>
        to the Woolsack, &quot;You are really helpless, and can do nothing to
        prevent<br>
        these gentlemen from helping themselves. If you leave the key there,<br>
        there is a fair chance of their treating your property as the Levite<br>
        treated the Good Samaritan. If not, your box will be decently opened<br>
        instead of having the lock broken or the hinges wrenched off.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">That was a good idea, and proved triumphantly successful;
        for, on<br>
        arrival at Montreux, the Chancery Barrister's portmanteau turned up all<br>
        right, the key innocently reposing on the handle, and, as subsequent<br>
        investigation showed, the contents untouched.</p>
      <p class="main">Our Manufacturer had a still better way, though, as was
        urged, he comes<br>
        from Yorkshire, and we of the southern part of the island have no chance<br>
        in competition with the race. He lost his luggage somewhere between<br>
        Dover and Paris, and has ever since been free from all care on the<br>
        subject.</p>
      <p class="main">Perhaps it was the influence of these varied incidents that
        led to a<br>
        scene of some excitement on our arrival at Montreux station. There,<br>
        what was left of our luggage was disgorged, and of fourteen packages<br>
        registered, only nine were visible to the naked eye. It was then the<br>
        Patriarch came to the front and displayed some of those qualities which<br>
        subsequently found a fuller field amid the solitude of the Alps.</p>
      <p class="main">We call him the Patriarch because he is a grandfather. In
        other respects<br>
        he is the youngest of the party, the first on the highest peak, the<br>
        first down in the afternoon with his ready order for &quot;tea for ten,&quot;
        of<br>
        which, if the party is late in arriving and he finds time hang heavy on<br>
        his hands, he will genially drink five cups himself. With the care of<br>
        half a dozen colossal commercial undertakings upon his mind, he is as<br>
        merry as a boy and as playful as a kitten. But when once aroused his<br>
        anger is terrible.</p>
      <p class="main">His thunder and lightning played around the station-master
        at Montreux<br>
        on the discovery of the absence of five packages. The Patriarch has a<br>
        wholesome faith in the all-sufficiency of the English language. The<br>
        station-master's sole lingual accomplishment was French. This<br>
        concatenation of circumstances might with ordinary persons have led to<br>
        some diminution of the force of adjuration. But probably the<br>
        station-master lost little of the meaning the Patriarch desired to<br>
        convey. This tended in the direction of showing the utter incapacity<br>
        of the Swiss or French nature to manage a railway, and the discreditable<br>
        incompetency of the officials of whatever grade. The station-master was<br>
        properly abashed before the torrent of indignant speech. But he had his<br>
        turn presently. Calmer inspection disclosed the fact that all the<br>
        fourteen packets were delivered. It was delightful to see how the<br>
        station-master, immediately assuming the offensive, followed the<br>
        Patriarch about with gesticulation indicative of the presence of the<br>
        baggage, and with taunting speech designed to make the Patriarch<br>
        withdraw his remarks--whatever they might have been. On this point<br>
        the station-master was not clear, but he had a shrewd suspicion that<br>
        they were not complimentary. The Patriarch, however, now retired upon<br>
        his dignity.</p>
      <p class="main">It was, as he said, no use arguing with fellows like this.</p>
      <p class="main">Les Avants sit high up among the mountains at the back of
        Montreux.<br>
        It seems madness to go there at a time when fires are still cheerful<br>
        and when the leaves have not yet put forth their greenness. But, as<br>
        was made apparent in due time, Les Avants, at no time inconveniently<br>
        cold, would be, but for the winds that blow over the snow-clad hills<br>
        surprisingly hot. To build an hotel here seems a perilously bold<br>
        undertaking. It is not on the way to anywhere, and people going from<br>
        the outer world must march up the hill, and, when they are tired of it,<br>
        must needs, like the Duke of York in his famous military expedition,<br>
        march down again. None but a Swiss would build an hotel here, and few<br>
        but English would frequent it. Yet the shrewdness of the proprietor has<br>
        been amply justified, and Les Avants is becoming in increasing degree<br>
        a favourite pilgrimage.</p>
      <p class="main">The hotel was built nearly twenty years ago. Previously
        the little<br>
        valley it dominates had been planted with one or two chalets which<br>
        for more than half a century have looked out upon the deathless snows<br>
        of the Dent du Midi. There is one which has rudely carved over the<br>
        lintel of its door the date 1816. Noting which, the Chancery Barrister,<br>
        with characteristic accuracy, observed that &quot;five centuries look
        down<br>
        upon us.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Our landlord is an enterprising man. His business in life
        is to keep an<br>
        hotel, and the height of his ambition is to keep it well. Only a<br>
        fortnight ago he returned from a grand tour of the winter<br>
        watering-places, from the Bay of Biscay to the Bay of Genoa. The<br>
        ordinary attractions of the show places from Biarritz to Bordighera had<br>
        no lure for him. What he studied were the hotels and their various modes<br>
        of management. He told us, with a flush of pride on his sun-tanned<br>
        cheek, that he travelled as an ordinary tourist. There was no hint of<br>
        his condition or the object of his journey, no appeal to confraternity<br>
        with a view to getting bed and breakfast at trade prices, or some<br>
        reduction on the <span class="italic">table d'h&ocirc;te</span> charges.
        He travelled as a sort of Haroun<br>
        al Raschid among innkeepers, haughtily paying his bills, and possibly<br>
        feeing the waiters. He is a very good sort of a fellow, attentive and<br>
        obliging, and it is odd how we all agree in the hope that he was from<br>
        time to time over-charged.</p>
      <p class="main">It is a fair prospect looked out upon from the bedroom window
        on our<br>
        arrival. Almost at our feet, it seems, is the Lake of Geneva, though<br>
        we remember the wearisome climb up the hill, and know it must be miles<br>
        away. On the other side are the snow-clad hills that reach down to<br>
        Savoy on the east, and are crowned by the heights of the Dent du Midi<br>
        on the west. On the left, flanking our own place of abode, rise up the<br>
        grim heights of the Roches de Naye, and, still farther back, the Dent<br>
        du Jaman--a terrible tooth this, which draws attention from all the<br>
        country round, and excites the wildest ambition of the tourist. The man<br>
        or woman resting within a circuit of ten miles of Montreux, who has not<br>
        touched the topmost heights of the Dent du Jaman, goes home a crushed<br>
        person. A very small proportion do it, but every one talks of doing<br>
        it---which, unless the weather be favourable, is perhaps the wiser<br>
        thing to do. It fills a large place in the conversation as well as in<br>
        the landscape, and it will be a bad thing for the Lake of Geneva if<br>
        this tooth should ever be drawn.</p>
      <p class="main">Lovely as was the scene in the fresh morning air, with the
        glistening<br>
        snow, the dark pines on the lower hills, the blue lake, and the<br>
        greyish upland, they did but serve to frame the picture of the<br>
        Patriarch as he sat upon the bench in the front of the hotel. A short<br>
        jacket of blue serge, knickerbockers of the same material, displaying<br>
        the proportions of a notable pair of legs, the whole crowned by a<br>
        chimney-pot hat, went to make up a remarkable figure. The Patriarch<br>
        had in his hand a blue net for catching butterflies. The Naturalist<br>
        had excited his imagination by stories of the presence of the<br>
        &quot;Camberwell Beauty,&quot; a rare and beautiful species of butterfly,
        of<br>
        which he was determined to take home a specimen. In later days he<br>
        was fair to see with his hat thrown back on his brow, his net in his<br>
        hand: and his stout legs twinkling in their haste to come up with a<br>
        butterfly.</p>
      <p class="main">The Alps have witnessed many strange sights since first
        they uplifted<br>
        their heads to heaven. But it is calculated that the Patriarch was<br>
        the first who brought under their notice the chimney-pot hat of the<br>
        civilised Englishman.</p>
      <p class="main">This haste to be up on the first morning was a faithful
        precursor of<br>
        the indomitable vitality of the Patriarch. He was always first up and<br>
        first off, and, amongst many charming peculiarities, was his<br>
        indifference as to which way the road lay. We generally had a guide<br>
        with us, and nothing was more common in toiling up a mountain side<br>
        than to discover the guide half a mile to the left and the Patriarch<br>
        half a mile to the right, something after the fashion of the letter Y,<br>
        we being at the stem. We saw a good deal more of the country than we<br>
        otherwise should have done, owing to the constant necessity of going<br>
        after the Patriarch and bringing him back. Sometimes he got away by<br>
        himself, at others he deluded some hapless member of the company into<br>
        following him. One young man, just called to the bar, had a promising<br>
        career almost cut short on the second day. In the innocence of his<br>
        heart he had followed the Patriarch, who led him through an apparently<br>
        impassable pine forest on to the crest of a remote hill, whence he<br>
        crawled down an hour late for luncheon, the Patriarch having arrived<br>
        ten minutes before him, and having already had his knife into every<br>
        receptacle for food that was spread out, from the loaf of bread to the<br>
        box of sardines, from the preserved peaches to the cup without a handle<br>
        that held the butter.</p>
      <p class="main">Walking up the hill behind the hotel on the way to the Jaman,
        the Member<br>
        had a happy idea. &quot;Why,&quot; he asked, &quot;should not the Parliamentary
        Session<br>
        be movable, like a reading party? Say the Bankruptcy Bill is referred<br>
        to a grand committee. What is to prevent them coming right off here and<br>
        settling down for a fortnight or three weeks, or in fact whatever time<br>
        might be necessary thoroughly to discuss the measure?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">They might do worse, we agreed, as we walked on, carefully
        selecting<br>
        the shady side of the road, and thinking of dear friends shivering in<br>
        England. The blue haze under which we know the lake lies; the Alps all<br>
        around, their green sides laced with snow and their heads covered with<br>
        it; the fleckless blue sky; the brown rocks, and over all and through<br>
        all the murmuring music of the invisible stream, as it trickles on its<br>
        way down the gorge, would be better accompaniments to a good grind at
        a<br>
        difficult Bill than any to be found within the precincts of Westminster.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;You remember what Virgil says?&quot; the Chancery
        Barrister strikes in.</p>
      <p class="main">Divers things of diverse character we have discovered invariably
        remind<br>
        the Chancery Barrister of Virgil or Horace, occasionally perchance of<br>
        an English poet. This is very pleasant, and none the less so because<br>
        the reminiscences come slowly, gathering strength as they advance, like<br>
        the Chancery Barrister's laugh, which begins like the pattering of rain<br>
        on leaves, and ends in the roar of a thunderstorm. The Chancery<br>
        Barrister takes his jokes gently to begin with: he sees them afar off,<br>
        and, closing one eye, begins to smile. The smile broadens to a grin, the<br>
        grin becomes a cachinnation, then, as he hugs the fun, the cachinnation<br>
        deepens to a roar of laughter, and the thing is complete.</p>
      <p class="main">It is thus with his quotations, though these are not always<br>
        completed--at least, not in accordance with recognised authorities. As<br>
        one of the ladies says, with that kindliness peculiar to the sex, &quot;The<br>
        Chancery Barrister is most original when he is making a quotation.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What's that Wolsey says about the pomps and vanities
        of this world?&quot;<br>
        &quot;'Vain pomps and vanities of this world,'&quot; the Chancery Barrister<br>
        begins, and we know we are in for a quotation. &quot;No, not pomps and<br>
        vanities. 'Vain pomps and glories of this world' (that's it)--&quot;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;'Vain pomp and glory of this world,
          I hate ye.<br>
          I feel my heart new opened. O how wretched<br>
          Is the poor man that hangs on princes' favours!<br>
          There is betwixt the smile we would aspire to,<br>
          That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin,<br>
          More pangs and fears than wars or women have.'&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">It's odd how one thing leads to another. By the time the
        Chancery<br>
        Barrister has got his quotation right, the Patriarch is half a mile<br>
        ahead in the wrong direction, and we all have to go and look for him.</p>
      <p class="main">The Col de Jaman is the salvation of many tourists. Not
        being regular<br>
        Alpine climbers, they start over the Dent and get as far as the Col,<br>
        rest awhile just under the great mountain molar, and come down. We had<br>
        a splendid day for our expedition. It had been freezing hard in the<br>
        night, and when we reached the snow region we found the pines frosted.<br>
        On the Col a beneficent commune has built some chalets furnished with<br>
        plentiful supply of firewood. Out of the sun it was bitterly cold, and<br>
        we were glad to light a fire, which crackled and roared up the broad<br>
        chimney and made a pretty accompaniment to the Chancery Barrister's<br>
        song about the Jolly Young Waterman. He sang it all in one key, and<br>
        that the wrong one. But it was a well-meant effort, and we all joined<br>
        in the chorus.</p>
      <p class="main">There's some talk to-day of a startling episode at an hotel
        up the<br>
        Rhone Valley. A Russian gentleman was sitting sipping his tea, when<br>
        there approached him a lady, who addressed him in three languages.<br>
        His replies not being satisfactory she shot him. This is cited by the<br>
        Chancery Barrister as showing the advantage of an early acquaintance<br>
        with foreign languages, and the desirableness of a pure accent.</p>
      <p class="main">It is quite agreed that if our Naturalist had been in the
        Russian's<br>
        place he would have been shot after the first question. This morning,<br>
        on ringing for his bath, he was answered by a chambermaid with a &quot;Pas<br>
        encore.&quot; Why &quot;not just yet&quot; our Naturalist did not know.
        He was not<br>
        unusually early. But he had done his duty. He had tried to get up and<br>
        have his bath; it was not ready, so he might go back to bed with a<br>
        quiet conscience. Presently came another knock, and our Naturalist,<br>
        carefully robing himself, opened the door, and discovered the<br>
        chambermaid standing there with a plate, a knife, and a breakfast roll.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What the dev----I mean <span class="italic">qu'c'est
        qu'c'est</span>?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;<span class="italic">Monsieur a demand&eacute; le
        petit pain</span>,&quot; the girl replied, astonished at<br>
        his astonishment.</p>
      <p class="main">With great presence of mind he accepted the situation, took
        in the<br>
        bread, and did without his bath. The Member says that, coming upon him<br>
        suddenly amid the silence of the snow, he heard him practising the<br>
        slightly different sounds of <span class="italic">pain</span> and <span class="italic">bain</span>.</p>
      <p class="main">Nothing but snow between the Col and the Dent du Jaman,
        but snow at its<br>
        very best, hard and dry. Just before we reach the top we come upon a<br>
        huge drift frozen hard and slippery. We might have gone round, but we<br>
        decided to try and climb. The Patriarch of course was first, and<br>
        achieved the task triumphantly. Others followed, and then came the<br>
        Chancery Barrister. Another step, and he would have safely landed.<br>
        But unhappily a quotation occurred to him.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;This is jolly,&quot; he said, turning half round,
        with the proud<br>
        consciousness that he was at the crest and that with another stride all<br>
        would be well; &quot;what's that Horace says about enjoying what you have?&quot;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;'Me pascant olivae,<br>
          Me cichorea, levesque malvae,<br>
          Frui paratis, et valido mihi,<br>
          Latoe, dones, et, precor, integra<br>
          Cum----'&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">Here the most terrible contortion appeared on the generally
        pleasant<br>
        countenance of the Chancery Barrister. He clutched desperately at the<br>
        ice; but his suspicion was too true. He had begun to move downwards<br>
        (&quot;When he got to <span class="italic">cum</span> he came,&quot; the
        Member, who makes bad jokes, says),<br>
        and with increasing impetus he slid down the bank. His face during the<br>
        terrible moments when he was not quite certain where he would stop, or<br>
        indeed whether he would ever stop, passed through a series of<br>
        contortions highly interesting to those on the bank above.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;<span class="italic">Me pascant olivae</span>!&quot;
        cried the Member. &quot;Olives are evidently no use as<br>
        a support in a case like yours, and diachylon would be more use to you<br>
        now than soft mallows.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The Chancery Barrister, who had happily reached the bottom,
        walked round<br>
        by a more accessible path, and nothing further either from Horace or<br>
        Virgil occurred to him for more than an hour.</p>
      <p class="main">Perhaps the difference in the weather had something to do
        with it, but<br>
        we found the Dent du Jaman not nearly so difficult to climb as the<br>
        Roches de Naye. After the scamper across the snow and the climb over<br>
        this little ice-collar down which the Chancery Barrister had slipped,<br>
        there is no more snow. We climb up by steps worn by the feet of many<br>
        adventurers. The top is a level cone with an area not much greater<br>
        than that of a moderate-sized dining-room. There was not a breath of<br>
        wind, and the sun beat down with a warmth made all the more delicious<br>
        by the recollection of the frozen region through which we had passed.<br>
        The Dent is only a trifle above six thousand feet high, but the prospect<br>
        as seen from it stretches far. Below is the Canton de Vaud, a portion
        of<br>
        the Jura chain of mountains, the far-reaching Alps of the Savoy, a bit<br>
        of the lake gleaming like an emerald under the white tops of the<br>
        mountains, a cloud on the southern horizon that the guide tells us are<br>
        the mountains of the Valais, and, still to the south just touched by the<br>
        sun, glitter the snow summits of the Great St. Bernard.</p>
      <p class="main">Coming down, we bivouac in the <span class="italic">ch&acirc;let</span>,
        lighting up the fire again.<br>
        Here, twelve hundred feet lower down, it is bitterly cold, in spite<br>
        of, perhaps because of, the fire. The <span class="italic">ch&acirc;let</span>
        is built with commendable<br>
        deference to the necessity for ventilation. The wind, smelling fire,<br>
        comes rushing over the snow, and we are glad to put on coat and caps.<br>
        The conversation turns to legal topics, and certain eminent personages<br>
        are discussed with great severity. Of one it is roundly asserted that<br>
        he is mad.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I am quite sure of it,&quot; said the Chancery Barrister,
        who has recovered<br>
        his spirits with his footing, &quot;and I'll tell you why. He seconded
        me<br>
        for the Reform Club, and----&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">We all agree that this is quite enough; but the Chancery
        Barrister<br>
        insists on proceeding with his narrative, of which it seems this was<br>
        merely the introduction.</p>
      <p class="main">We found our Naturalist of very little use. We had expected
        he would<br>
        mount with us whatever heights we sought, and had pleasing views of<br>
        his explaining the flora as we went along. But he always had some<br>
        excuse that kept him on lower levels. One morning he declared he had<br>
        passed a sleepless night owing to the efforts of two Scotch lads who<br>
        occupied the room next to him. They had some taste for carpentering,<br>
        and were addicted to getting up in the dead of the night and doing odd<br>
        jobs about the room. At half-past five a.m. they left their couch and<br>
        began playing Cain and Abel. Only the Naturalist protested there is no<br>
        authority in Scripture for the fearful row Abel made when Cain got him<br>
        down on his back.</p>
      <p class="main">At other times our Naturalist had heard of a &quot;Camberwell
        Beauty&quot; in<br>
        the neighbourhood, and must needs go and catch it, which, by the way,<br>
        he never did. On the whole, we conclude our Naturalist is an impostor.</p>
      <p class="main">We reserved the Roches de Naye till the last day. It was
        rather a<br>
        stupendous undertaking, the landlord assuring us that four guides were<br>
        necessary. One led a horse that no one would ride, one carried the<br>
        indispensable luncheon-basket, and two fared forth at early morn to cut<br>
        steps in the snow. The sun was shining when we started on this desperate<br>
        enterprise, and it was hot enough as we toiled along the lower heights.<br>
        But when we reached the snow level, the sun had gone in, having just<br>
        shone long enough to make the snow wet. Then a cold bleak wind set in,<br>
        and we began to think that, after all, there was more in the Naturalist<br>
        than met the eye. Whilst we were toiling along, sometimes temporarily<br>
        despairing, and generally up to our waists in snow, he was enjoying the<br>
        comforts of the hotel, or strolling about in languid search of fabulous<br>
        butterflies.</p>
      <p class="main">Picking our way round a hill in which had been cut in the
        snow a ledge<br>
        about two feet wide, we came in face of the slope we were to climb. Up<br>
        at the top, looking like black ants, were the guides cutting a zigzag<br>
        path in the snow. The Member observed that if any one were to offer<br>
        him a sovereign and his board on condition of his climbing up this<br>
        slope, he would prefer to remain in indigent circumstances. As we<br>
        were getting nothing for the labour, were indeed paying for the<br>
        privilege of undertaking it, we stuck at it, and after a steady climb<br>
        reached the top, when the wind was worse than ever. It was past<br>
        luncheon time, and every one was ferociously hungry; but it was agreed<br>
        that if we camped here and lunched, we should never get to the top. So<br>
        on we went, through the sloppy snow, pursued by the keen blast that<br>
        cut through all possible clothing.</p>
      <p class="main">It was a hard pull and not much to see for it, since clouds
        had rolled<br>
        up from the west and hid the promised panorama. The wind was terrible,<br>
        and there was no shelter. But we could hold out no longer, and the<br>
        luncheon being laid upon the sloppy grass, the Patriarch, with his<br>
        accustomed impartiality, went round with his knife.</p>
      <p class="main">By this time we had induced him to take the sardines last,
        which he<br>
        obligingly did.</p>
      <p class="main">We ran most of the way back to the side of the hill where
        the snow had<br>
        been cut. The exercise made us a little warmer; and the genial influence<br>
        of the cold fowl, the hard-boiled eggs, the sardines and the thin red<br>
        wine beginning to work, we were able to enjoy the spectacle of the<br>
        Patriarch leading the first party down the perilous incline. We had<br>
        ropes, but didn't think it worth while to be tied. The party was divided<br>
        into two sections, half a dozen holding on to a rope. It must have been<br>
        a beautiful sight from many a near mountain height to watch the<br>
        Patriarch's chimney-pot hat slowly move downwards on the zigzag path.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What's that Virgil says about ranging mountain tops?&quot;
        said the Chancery<br>
        Barrister:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Me Parnassi deserta per ardua dulcis<br>
          Raptat amor: juvat ire jugis, qua nulla priorum<br>
          Castaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">He had got in the centre of the second party, and with two
        before him,<br>
        three behind, and a firm grip on the rope, he thought it safe to quote<br>
        poetry.</p>
      <p class="main">We had eight days at Les Avants, of which this devoted to
        the ascent of<br>
        the Roches was the only one the sun did not shine upon. Whether on<br>
        mountain or in valley, what time the sun was shining it was delightfully<br>
        warm. The narcissi were not yet out, but the fields were thick with<br>
        their buds. How the place would look when their glory had burst forth
        on<br>
        all the green Alps we could only imagine. But already everywhere bloomed<br>
        the abundant marigolds, the hepaticae, the violets, the oxlips, the<br>
        gentians, the primroses, and the forget-me-nots.</p>

      <p class="boldleft">THE BATTLE OF MERTHYR.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Well, sir, it is, as you say, a long time ago, but
        it was one of those<br>
        things, look you, that a man meets with only once in his lifetime; and<br>
        that being so, I might call it all to mind if I began slowly, and went<br>
        on so as to keep my pipe alight to the end.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The speaker was a little, white-haired miner, who had been
        employed for<br>
        fifty years by the Crawshays, of Cyfarthfa. We were sitting in the<br>
        sanctum of his kitchen, the beautifully sanded floor of which smote me<br>
        with remorse, for I had walked up from Merthyr, and was painfully<br>
        conscious of two muddy footprints in the doorway.</p>
      <p class="main">Mrs. Morgan Griffiths, engaged upon the task of repairing
        Mr. Morgan<br>
        Griffiths's hose, was seated in the middle of the room opposite the<br>
        fireplace, having against the wall on either side of her a mahogany<br>
        chest of drawers in resplendent state of polish. Mr. Morgan Griffiths<br>
        sat beside the fireplace, with his pipe in one hand, the other resting<br>
        affectionately upon another mahogany chest of drawers, also<br>
        resplendently polished, standing in a recess at his left. The other side<br>
        of the fireplace was occupied by the visitor, who, if he had turned his<br>
        head a little to the right, might have seen his face reflected in the<br>
        resplendent polish of a third mahogany chest of drawers, which somewhat<br>
        inconveniently projected from the recess on the side of the fireplace.</p>
      <p class="main">Apparently, every well-to-do Welsh collier marks his status
        in society<br>
        by the possession of a mahogany chest of drawers--if mounted in brass<br>
        so much the better--which it is the pride and privilege of his wife to<br>
        keep in a state of resplendent polish. Mr. Morgan Griffiths having had
        a<br>
        long run of prosperity, and being of a frugal mind, had launched out<br>
        largely in the purchase of mahogany chests of drawers, and his kitchen<br>
        may be said to bristle with them. Each had its history, and it was to<br>
        the patient listening to the repetition thereof, and to the expenditure<br>
        of much appreciative criticism upon the varied styles of architecture<br>
        displayed in their construction, that I completely won Mr. Morgan<br>
        Griffiths's confidence, and overcame the cautious fencing with which<br>
        he met my first inquiries touching his recollection of the memorable<br>
        Merthyr Riots of 1831.</p>
      <p class="main">Perfect confidence reigned between us now, and I discovered
        that,<br>
        though it is exceedingly hard to get a Welsh miner to talk freely to<br>
        &quot;a Saxon,&quot; when he opens his heart, and can look back for a
        period of<br>
        fifty years, he is a very interesting companion.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes, it's a long time ago,&quot; Mr. Morgan Griffiths
        repeated, in short,<br>
        clipping intonation of the English language I will not attempt to<br>
        reproduce, &quot;but I've often talked it over with Mrs. Morgan Griffiths,<br>
        and I can see it all now. Times was sore bad, and there was a deal<br>
        of poverty about. Bread was dear, and iron was cheap--at least so Mr.<br>
        Crawshay said when we went up to ask him if he couldn't give us<br>
        miners a trifle over the twelve or thirteen shillings a week we was<br>
        earning. Everybody I knowed was in debt, and had been in debt for<br>
        some time, and was getting further in every week. The shopkeepers<br>
        up at Merthyr were getting uneasy about their money, and besides<br>
        saying plump out to some of us that we couldn't have any more bread,<br>
        or that, without money down on the nail, they served out all round<br>
        summonses to what was called the Court of Requests. That was all<br>
        very well, but as we couldn't get enough to eat from day to day<br>
        upon our wages, it was pretty certain we couldn't go and pay up<br>
        arrears. But the summonses came all the same, and it was a black<br>
        look-out, I can tell you.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;One day, in the middle of the summer of this year
        1831, there was<br>
        a great meeting out on Waun-hill of all the miners of the country.<br>
        I can't rightly tell you the day of the month, but it was about<br>
        three reeks after we rescued Thomas Llewellin, who had been sent<br>
        to gaol on account of the row at Mr. Stephens's. We talked over<br>
        our grievances together, and we made up our minds that we couldn't<br>
        stand them any longer, though we meant no more mischief than our<br>
        little Morgan who wasn't born then, me and Mrs. Morgan Griffiths<br>
        not being married at the time, nor indeed set eyes on each other.<br>
        After the row opposite the Bush Inn, I went back to my work till<br>
        such time as the petition we had agreed to send to the King was<br>
        written out by Owen Evans, and had come round to be signed by us<br>
        all. But there was others not so peaceably minded, and a lot of<br>
        them, meeting outside Merthyr, marched over the hill to Aberdare,<br>
        where they went to Mr. Fothergill's and treated him pretty<br>
        roughly. They ate up all the victuals in the house, and finished<br>
        up all the beer, and then took a turn round the town collecting<br>
        all the bread and cheese they could lay their hands on.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;A lad sent by Mr. Fothergill came running over the
        mountain with<br>
        a letter to the magistrates, telling them what was happening in<br>
        Aberdare, and pressing them to send off for the soldiers. It was<br>
        said the magistrates did this pretty quick, but we had no railways<br>
        or telegraphs then, and, ride as quick as you might, the soldiers<br>
        could not get here before morning. The men from Aberdare were back<br>
        here the same night, and marched straight for the Court of Requests,<br>
        where they made poor Coffin, the clerk, give up every scrap of book<br>
        or paper he had about the Court's business, and they made a bonfire<br>
        of them in the middle of the street. Then they came over here, and<br>
        swore we should all turn out and join them.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I remember it well. I was just coming up from the
        pit to go to my<br>
        tea, when they came bursting over the tips, shouting and waving<br>
        their sticks, and wearing in their hats little bits of burnt paper<br>
        from the bonfire opposite Coffin's house. They were most of them<br>
        drunk, but they were very friendly with us, and only wanted us to<br>
        leave off work and go along with them. I was a young fellow then,<br>
        up to any lark, and didn't make much fuss about it. So off we<br>
        went to Dowlais, freed the men there, and we all had a good drink<br>
        together.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Next day the soldiers came in earnest: Scotchmen with
        petticoats<br>
        on, and nasty-looking guns on their shoulders. I stood in a passage<br>
        whilst they marched down High Street from Cyfarthfa way, and didn't<br>
        like the look of things at all. But close upon their heels came all<br>
        our fellows, with bludgeons in their hands, and one of them, a man<br>
        from Dowlais, had tied a red pocket-handkerchief on a stick and waved<br>
        it over his head like a flag. The soldiers tramped steadily along till<br>
        they got just above the Castle Inn, and there they halted, our men<br>
        pressing on till they filled the open place below the Castle, as well<br>
        as crowding the street behind the soldiers, who looked to me, as I<br>
        hung on by the hands and legs to a lamp-post, just like a patch of red<br>
        in the centre of a great mass of black. The soldiers had some bread<br>
        and cheese and beer served out to them, but they were a long time<br>
        getting it; for as soon as any one came out of the Castle with a loaf<br>
        of bread and a piece of cheese some of our men snatched it out of<br>
        their hands and eat it, jeering at the soldiers and offering them bits.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;The soldiers never said a word or budged an inch till
        the Sheriff<br>
        looked out of the window and asked the little fellow who was their<br>
        commander-in-chief to draw them up on the pavement close before the<br>
        hotel. The little fellow said something to them; and they turned round<br>
        their guns so as the butt ends were presented, and marched straight<br>
        forward, as if our fellows were not on the pavement as thick as ants.<br>
        There was a little stoppage owing to the men not being able to clear<br>
        off because of the crowd on the right and left. But the thick ends of<br>
        the guns went steadily on with the bare-legged silent soldiers after<br>
        them, and in a few strides the pavement was clear, and the soldiers<br>
        were eating their bread and cheese with their faces to the crowd, and<br>
        a tight right-handed grip on their muskets.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;The Sheriff got on a chair in the doorway of the Castle,
        with the<br>
        soldiers well placed between him and us, and made a rigmaroling<br>
        speech about law and order, and the King; but he said nothing about<br>
        giving us more wages. Our master, Mr. Crawshay, was in the hotel too,<br>
        and so was Mr. Guest, of Dowlais. Evan Jones, a man who had come over<br>
        from Aberdare, got up on the shoulders of his mates and made a<br>
        rattling speech all about our poor wages.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;'Law and order's all very well,&quot; he said, &quot;but
        can you live on twelve<br>
        shillings a week, Mr. Sheriff, and bring up a lot of little sheriffs?'</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Then we all shouted, and old Crawshay coming up to
        the doorway, I got<br>
        down from the lamp-post, not wishing to let him see me there, though I<br>
        was only standing on my rights. But Mr. William had a voice which,<br>
        something like an old file at work, could go through any crowd, and I<br>
        heard him in his quiet, stern way, just as if he was talking to his men<br>
        on a pay-day, say it was no use them crowding there with sticks and<br>
        stones to talk to him about wages.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;'Go home, all of you' he said; 'go to bed; and when
        you are sober and<br>
        in your senses, send us a deputation from each mine, and we'll see what<br>
        can be done. But you won't be sensible for a fortnight after this mad<br>
        acting; so let us say on this day fortnight you come with your<br>
        deputation. Now go home, and don't make fools of yourselves any more.'</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;We always listened to what Mr. Crawshay said, though
        he might be a<br>
        little hard sometimes, and this made us waver. But just then<br>
        Lewis-yr-Helwyr, shouting out in Welsh, 'We ask for more wages and they<br>
        give us soldiers,' leaped at the throat of the Scotchman nearest to him,<br>
        and snatching the musket out of his hand, stuck the bayonet into him.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;In the twinkling of an eye the great black mass jumped
        upon the little<br>
        red patch I told you of, and a fearful struggle began. The attack was
        so<br>
        sudden, and the soldiers were at the moment so earnest with their bread<br>
        and cheese, that nearly all the front rank men lost their muskets and<br>
        pressed backward on their comrades behind. These levelled their pieces<br>
        over the front rank's shoulders and fired straight into the thick of us.<br>
        The little officer had hardly given the word to fire when he was knocked<br>
        down by a blow on the head, and a bayonet stuck into him, Our men<br>
        pressed stoutly forward and, tumbling over the dead, fell upon the<br>
        soldiers, who could move neither arm nor leg. The rear rank were, as<br>
        fast as they could bustle, filing into the hotel, but not before they<br>
        had managed to pass over their heads the little officer, who looked very<br>
        sick, with the blood streaming down his face.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;At last the soldiers all got inside the doorway of
        the hotel, where<br>
        they stood fast like a wedge, two kneeling down shoulder to shoulder<br>
        with their bayonets fixed, three others firing over their heads, and<br>
        others behind handing up loaded guns as fast as they fired. There was
        a<br>
        lane speedily made amongst us in front of the doorway; but we had won<br>
        the fight for all that, and cheered like mad when the soldiers turned<br>
        tail.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;In a few minutes we shouted on the other side of our
        mouths. Without<br>
        any notice the windows of every room in the hotel suddenly flew up, and<br>
        out came from each the muzzles of a pair of muskets which flashed death<br>
        down upon us at the rate of two men a minute; for as soon as the first<br>
        couple of soldiers fired they retired and reloaded whilst two others<br>
        took their places and blazed away. A rush was made to the back of the<br>
        hotel, and we had got into the passage, when the bearded faces of the<br>
        Scotchmen showed through the smoke with which the house was filled, and<br>
        the leaders of our lot were shoved back at the point of the bayonet. At<br>
        the same time the windows at the back of the house flew up as they had<br>
        done in the front, and the muzzles of the muskets peeped out as they<br>
        had done before.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;This was getting rather hot for me. Men dead or dying
        were lying about<br>
        everywhere around the Castle Inn. If I had been asked that night how<br>
        many were killed, I think I should have said two hundred; but when the<br>
        accounts came to be made up, it was found that not more than sixty or<br>
        seventy were shot dead, though many more were wounded. I was neither<br>
        hurt nor dead as yet, and I thought I had better go home if I wanted to<br>
        keep so. I was below the Castle Inn at the time, and not caring to pass<br>
        the windows with those deadly barrels peeping out I turned down High<br>
        Street, and walked through the town. It was raining in torrents, and I<br>
        never saw Merthyr look so wretched. Every shop was closed, and<br>
        barricades placed across some of the windows of the private houses; and<br>
        as I walked along, trying to look as if I hadn't been up at the Castle,<br>
        I saw white faces peeping over window blinds.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Merthyr was trembling in its shoes that day, I can
        tell you; and it<br>
        came out afterwards that every tradesman in the place had got together<br>
        all the bread, cheese, meat, pies, and beer he could put his hands on,<br>
        ready to throw out to the mob if they came knocking at his door.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;It was late at night when I got home, having gone
        a long way round, and<br>
        I saw nothing more of our fellows; but I heard that the wounded soldiers<br>
        had been taken up to Penydarren House, which was fortified by their<br>
        comrades, and held all night against our men. Somehow the word got<br>
        passed round that we were to meet the next morning in a quiet place on<br>
        the Brecon road, and when I got there I found our gallant fellows in<br>
        great force. I, having neither sword nor gun, was told off with a lot
        of<br>
        others to get up on the heights that bank the turnpike road near<br>
        Coedycymmer, and roll down big stones, so that the fresh troops expected<br>
        up from Brecon could not pass. This we did with a will; and when, in the<br>
        afternoon, a lot of cavalry came up, we made it so hot for them, what<br>
        with the stones rolled down from above and the musketry that came<br>
        rattling up from our men who had guns, that they cleared off pretty<br>
        smartly.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;This cheered us greatly, and another lot of ours,
        who had been posted<br>
        on the Swansea road to intercept troops coming up in that direction,<br>
        soon after joined us, with news of a great victory, by which they had<br>
        routed the soldiers and taken their swords and muskets. We thought<br>
        Merthyr was ours, though I'm not sure that we quite knew what we were<br>
        going to do with it. When somebody shouted, 'Let's go to Merthyr!' we<br>
        all shouted with him, and ran along the road, intending to take<br>
        Penydarren House by storm. On the way we met Evan Price and some others,<br>
        who had been to see Mr. Guest, and had been promised fine things for the<br>
        men if they would give up their arms and go peaceably to work. Some<br>
        jumped at this offer and sneaked off; but I had got a sabre now, and was<br>
        in for death or glory. There was a good many in the same boat, and on
        we<br>
        went towards Penydarren House, enough of us to eat it up, if the walls<br>
        had been built of boiled potatoes instead of bricks.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;When we got in sight of the house, we found they were
        ready for us, and<br>
        had got a lot of those soldiers drawn up in battle array. There was a<br>
        deal of disputing amongst our leaders how the attack was to commence,<br>
        and whilst they were chattering the men were dropping off in twos and<br>
        threes, and in about an hour we were all gone, so nothing more was<br>
        done that night.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;We lay quietly in our own homes on Sunday, and on
        Monday had a great<br>
        meeting on Waun-hill again, colliers coming up by thousands to join up<br>
        from all parts around. Early in the forenoon we began to move down<br>
        towards Merthyr, everybody in high spirits, shouting, waving caps, and<br>
        brandishing swords. I saw one man get an awful backhanded cut on the<br>
        cheek from an Aberdare collier, who was waving his sword about like a<br>
        madman. Nobody knew exactly where we were going, or what we were going<br>
        to do; but when we got as far as Dowlais we were saved the trouble of<br>
        deciding, for there was Mr. Guest, with a great army of soldiers drawn<br>
        up across the road. Mr. Guest was as cool as myself, and rode forward<br>
        to meet us as if we were the best friends in the world. He made a good<br>
        speech, begging us to think of our wives and families, and go quietly<br>
        home whilst we had the chance. Nothing came of that, however, and he<br>
        pulled out a paper, and read an Act of Parliament, after which he<br>
        turned to the commander-in chief of the soldiers, and said he had done<br>
        all a magistrate could do, and the soldiers must do the rest.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;'Get ready,' shouts out the commander-in-chief; and
        the soldiers<br>
        brought their muskets down with a flash like lightning, and a clash that<br>
        made me feel uncomfortable, remembering what I had seen on the Friday.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;'Present!'</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;There was ten murderous barrels looking straight at
        us. Another word,<br>
        and we should have their contents amongst our clothes. It was an awful<br>
        moment. I saw one black-bearded fellow had covered me as if I were a<br>
        round target, and I said to myself as well as I could speak for my lips<br>
        were like parched peas, 'Morgan Griffiths, twelve shillings a week and<br>
        an allowance of coal is better than this'; and I'm not ashamed to own<br>
        that I turned round and made my way through the crush of our men, which<br>
        was getting less inconveniently pressing at the end nearest to the<br>
        levelled barrels.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;There was, to tell the truth, a good deal of movement
        towards the rear<br>
        amongst our men, and when Mr. Guest saw this he rode up again, and,<br>
        standing right between the guns and the front rank of our men, said<br>
        something which I could not rightly hear, and then our men began running<br>
        off faster than ever, so that in about half an hour the soldiers had the<br>
        road to themselves.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;That was not the last of the riots, but it is all
        I can tell you about<br>
        them, for I had had quite enough of the business. There is something<br>
        about the look of a row of muskets pointed at you, with ball inside the<br>
        barrels and a steady finger on the triggers, which you don't care to see<br>
        too often.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Anyhow, I went home, and there heard tell of more
        fighting all that<br>
        week on the Brecon road, of Merthyr in a state of panic, and at last of<br>
        Dick Penderyn and Lewis the Huntsman being taken, and the whole of our<br>
        men scattered about the country, and hunted as if they were rats.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;It was a bad business, sir--a very bad business, and
        I know no more<br>
        than them as was shot down in the front of the Castle Hotel how it came<br>
        about or what we meant to do. We were like a barrel of gunpowder that<br>
        had been broken up and scattered about the road. A spark came, and<br>
        poof!--we went off with a bang, and couldn't stop ourselves. Yes, this<br>
        is a bad business, too, this strike of to-day, and there's a good many<br>
        thousand men going about idle and hungry who were busy and full a month<br>
        ago. I don't feel the bitterness of it myself so much, because I have
        a<br>
        little store in the house. I had been saving it to buy another chest of<br>
        drawers to stand there, opposite the door, but it's going out now in<br>
        bread and meat, and I don't know whether I shall live to save up enough<br>
        after the trouble's over, for I'm getting old now, look you.&quot;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="137"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">MOSQUITOES AND MONACO.</p>
      <p class="main">Up to the end of October, in ordinary seasons, the mosquitoes
        hold<br>
        their own against all comers along the full length of the Riviera. For<br>
        some unexplained reasons they clear out earlier from Genoa, though the<br>
        atmosphere may be as unbearably close as at other points of the coast<br>
        which mosquitoes have in most melancholy manner marked as their own.<br>
        Perhaps it is the noise of the city that scares them. The people live<br>
        in the street as much as possible, and therein conduct their converse<br>
        in highly-pitched notes. I have a strong suspicion that, like the<br>
        habitation jointly rented by Messrs. Box and Cox, Genoa is tenanted by<br>
        two distinct populations. One fills the place by day and throughout the<br>
        evening up to about ten o'clock; after this hour it disappears, and<br>
        there is a brief interval of rare repose. About 2 a.m. the Cox of this<br>
        joint tenancy appears on the scene, and by four there is a full tide<br>
        of bustle that murders sleep as effectually as was ever done by Macbeth.<br>
        I do not wonder that the mosquitoes (who, I have the best reason to<br>
        know, are insects of the finest discrimination and the most exacting<br>
        good taste) quit Genoa at the earliest possible moment.</p>
      <p class="main">The most delightful spot in or near the city is, to my mind,
        Campo<br>
        Santo, the place where rich Genoese go when they die. The burial-ground<br>
        is a large plot of ill-kept land, where weeds grow, and mean little<br>
        crosses rear their heads. Round this run colonnades adorned with<br>
        statuary, generally life-size, and frequently of striking merit.<br>
        Originally, it is presumable that the sculptor's art was invoked in<br>
        order to perpetuate the memory of the dead. There are in some of the<br>
        recesses, either in the form of medallions or busts, life-like<br>
        representations of those who have gone before. But the fashion of the<br>
        day is improving upon this. In the newest sculptures there is<br>
        exceedingly little of the dead, and as much as possible of the living.</p>
      <p class="main">About half-way down the colonnade, entering from the right,
        there is a<br>
        memorable group. A woman of middle age, portly presence and expansive<br>
        dress, is discovered in the centre on her knees, with hands clasped.<br>
        The figure is life-size and every detail of adornment, from the heavy<br>
        bracelet on her wrist to the fine lace of her collar, is wrought from<br>
        the imperishable marble. On her face is an expression of profound grief,<br>
        tempered by the consciousness that her large earrings have been done<br>
        justice to. Standing at a respectful distance behind her is a youth with<br>
        bared head drooped, and a tear delicately chiselled in the eye nearest<br>
        to the spectator. He carries his hat in his hand, displays much<br>
        shirt-cuff; and the bell-shaped cut of the trouser lying over his dainty<br>
        boot makes his foot look preciously small.</p>
      <p class="main">These figures, both life-size, stand in an arched recess,
        and show to<br>
        the best advantage. Just above the arch the more observant visitor will<br>
        catch sight of a small medallion, modestly displaying, about half<br>
        life-size, the face of an ordinary-looking man, who may have been a<br>
        prosperous linendraper or a cheesefactor with whom the markets had gone<br>
        well. This is presumably the deceased, and it is difficult to imagine<br>
        anything more soothing to the feelings of his widow and son than to come<br>
        here in the quiet evenings or peaceful mornings and contemplate their<br>
        own life-sized figures so becomingly bereaved.</p>
      <p class="main">Mosquitoes do not meddle with woe so sacred as this; but
        at San Remo,<br>
        for example, which has no Campo Santo, they are having what is known in<br>
        the American language as a high old time. Along the Riviera the shutters<br>
        of the hotels are taken down in the first week of October. Then arrives<br>
        the proprietor with the advance guard of servants, and the third cook;<br>
        the <span class="italic">chef </span>and his first lieutenant will not
        come till a month later. In<br>
        the meantime the third cook can prepare the meals for the establishment<br>
        and for any chance visitor whom evil fate may have led untimeously into<br>
        these parts. Then begins the scrubbing down and the dusting, the<br>
        bringing out of stored carpets, and the muffling of echoing corridors<br>
        in brown matting. The season does not commence till November,<br>
        coincidental with the departure of the mosquitoes. But there is enough<br>
        to occupy the interval, and there are not wanting casual travellers<br>
        whose bills suffice to cover current expenses. On these wayfarers the<br>
        faithful mosquito preys with the desperate determination born of the<br>
        conviction that time is getting a little short with him, and that his<br>
        pleasant evenings are numbered.</p>
      <p class="main">There are several ways of dealing with the mosquito, all
        more or less<br>
        unsatisfactory. The commonest is to make careful examination before<br>
        blowing out the candle, with intent to see that none of the enemy<br>
        lingers within the curtains of the bed. This is good, as far as it<br>
        goes. But, having spent half an hour with candle in hand inside the<br>
        curtains, to the imminent danger of setting the premises on fire, and<br>
        having convinced yourself that there is not a mosquito in the inclosure,<br>
        and so blown out the candle and prepared to sleep, it requires a mind<br>
        of singular equanimity forthwith to hear without emotion the too<br>
        familiar whiz. At Bordighera the mosquitoes, disdaining strategic<br>
        movements, openly flutter round the lamps on the dinner-table, and<br>
        ladies sit at meat with blue gauze veils obscuring their charms. Half<br>
        measures were evidently of no use in these circumstances, and I tried<br>
        a whole one. Having shut the windows of the bedroom, I smoked several<br>
        cigars, tobacco fumes being understood to have a dreamy influence on<br>
        the mosquito. At Bordighera they had none. I next made a fire of a box<br>
        of matches, and burnt on the embers a quantity of insect powder. This<br>
        filled the chamber with an intolerable stench, which, whatever may be<br>
        the case elsewhere, is much enjoyed by the Bordighera mosquito. These<br>
        operations serve a useful purpose in occupying the mind and helping<br>
        the night to pass away. But as direct deterrents they cannot<br>
        conscientiously be recommended.</p>
      <p class="main">There is one place along the Riviera where the mosquito
        is defied.<br>
        Monaco has special attractions of its own which triumphantly<br>
        withstand all countervailing influences. Other places along the<br>
        coast are deserted from the end of June to the beginning of November.<br>
        But Monaco, or rather the suburb of it situated on Monte Carlo,<br>
        remains in full receipt of custom. In late October the place is<br>
        enchanting. The wind, blowing across the sea from Africa, making the<br>
        atmosphere heavy and sultry, has changed, coming now from the east<br>
        and anon from the west. The heavy clouds that cast shadows of purple<br>
        and reddish-brown on the sea have descended in a thunderstorm, lasting<br>
        continuously for eight hours. Sky and sea vie in the production of<br>
        larger expanse of undimmed blue. The well-ordered garden by the Casino<br>
        is sweet with the breath of roses and heliotrope. The lawns have the<br>
        fresh green look that we islanders associate with earliest summer. The<br>
        palm-trees are at their best, and along the road leading down to the<br>
        bathing place one walks under the shadow of oleanders in full and<br>
        fragrant blossom. The warmth of the summer day is tempered by a<br>
        delicious breeze, which falls at night, lest peradventure visitors<br>
        should be incommoded by undue measure of cold.</p>
      <p class="main">If there is an easily accessible Paradise on earth, it seems
        to be<br>
        fixed at Monaco. Yet all these things are as nothing in the eyes of<br>
        the people who have created and now maintain the place. It seems at<br>
        first sight a marvel that the Administration should go to the expense<br>
        of providing the costly appointments which crown its natural advantages.<br>
        But the Administration know very well what they are about. When man or<br>
        woman has been drawn into the feverish vortex that sweeps around the<br>
        gaming tables, the fair scene outside the walls is not of the slightest<br>
        consequence. It would be all the same to them if the gaming tables,<br>
        instead of being set in a handsome apartment in a palace surrounded by<br>
        one of the most beautiful scenes in Europe, were made of deal and<br>
        spread in a hovel. But gamesters are, literally, soon played out at<br>
        Monaco, and it is necessary to attract fresh moths to the gaudily<br>
        glittering candle. Moreover, the tenure of the place is held by slender<br>
        threads. What is thought of Monaco and its doings by those who have the<br>
        fullest opportunity of studying them is shown by the fact that the<br>
        Administration are pledged to refuse admission to the tables to any<br>
        subject of the Prince of Monaco, or to any French subject of Nice or<br>
        the department of the Maritime Alps. The proclamation of this fact<br>
        cynically stares in the face all who enter the Casino. The local<br>
        authorities will not have any of their own neighbours ruined. Let<br>
        foreigners, or even Frenchmen of other departments, care for themselves.</p>
      <p class="main">In face of this sentiment the Administration find it politic
        to<br>
        propitiate the local authorities and the people, who, if they were<br>
        aroused to a feeling of honest indignation at what daily passes beneath<br>
        their notice, might sweep the pestilence out of their midst.<br>
        Accordingly, whilst keeping the gaming rooms closed against natives<br>
        resident in the department, the Administration throw open all the other<br>
        pleasures of Monte Carlo, inviting the people of Monaco to stroll in<br>
        their beautiful gardens, to listen to the concerts played twice a day
        by<br>
        a superb band, and to make unfettered use of what is perhaps the best<br>
        reading-room on the Continent. Monaco gets a good deal of pleasure out<br>
        of Monte Carlo, which moreover brings much good money into the place.<br>
        The Casino will surely at no distant day share the fate of the German<br>
        gambling places. But, as surely, the initiative of this most desirable<br>
        consummation will not come from Monaco.</p>
      <p class="main">In the meanwhile, Monte Carlo, like the mosquitoes, is having
        a high<br>
        good time. Night and day the tables are crowded, beginning briskly at<br>
        eleven in the morning and closing wearily on the stroke of midnight.<br>
        There are a good many English about, but they do not contribute largely<br>
        to the funds of the amiable and enterprising Administration. English<br>
        girls, favoured by an indulgent father or a good-natured brother, put<br>
        down their five-franc pieces, and, having lost them, go away smiling.<br>
        Sometimes the father or the brother may be discovered seated at the<br>
        tables later in the day, looking a little flushed, and poorer by some<br>
        sovereigns. But Great Britain and Ireland chiefly contribute spectators<br>
        to the melancholy and monotonous scene.</p>
      <p class="main">As usual, women are among the most reckless players. Looking
        in at two<br>
        o'clock one afternoon I saw at one of the tables a well-dressed lady of<br>
        about thirty, with a purseful of gold before her and a bundle of notes<br>
        under her elbow. She was playing furiously, disdaining the mild<br>
        excitement of the five-franc piece, always staking gold. She was losing,<br>
        and boldly played on with an apparent composure belied by her flushed<br>
        cheeks and flashing eyes. I saw her again at ten o'clock in the evening.<br>
        She was playing at another table, having probably tried to retrieve her<br>
        luck at each in succession. The bank notes were gone, and she had put<br>
        away her purse, for it was easy to hold in her prettily-gloved hand her<br>
        remaining store of gold. It was only eight hours since I had last seen<br>
        her, but in the meantime she had aged by at least ten years. She sat<br>
        looking fixedly on the table, from time to time moistening her dry lips<br>
        with scarcely less dry tongue. Her face wore a look of infinite sadness,<br>
        which might have been best relieved by a burst of tears. But her eyes<br>
        were as dry as her lips, and she stared stonily, staking her napoleons<br>
        till the last was gone. This accomplished, she rose with evident intent<br>
        to leave the room, but catching sight of a friend at another table she<br>
        borrowed a handful of napoleons, and finding another table played on<br>
        as recklessly as before. In ten minutes she had lost all but a single<br>
        gold piece. Leaving the table again, she held this up between her finger<br>
        and thumb, and showed it to her friend with a hysterical little laugh.</p>
      <p class="main">It was her last coin, and she evidently devised it for some
        such<br>
        matter-of-fact purpose as paying her hotel bill. If she had turned her<br>
        back on the table and walked straight out, she might have kept her<br>
        purpose; but the ball was still rolling, and there remained a chance.<br>
        She threw down the napoleon, and the croupier raked it in amid a heap
        of<br>
        coin that might be better or even worse spared.</p>
      <p class="main">This is one of the little dramas that take place every hour
        in this<br>
        gilded hall, and I describe it in detail only because I chanced to be<br>
        present at the first scene and the last. Sometimes the dramas become<br>
        tragedies, and the Administration, who do all things handsomely, pay<br>
        the funeral expenses, and beg as a slight acknowledgment of their<br>
        considerate generosity that as little noise as possible may follow<br>
        the echo of the pistol-shot.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="145"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">A WRECK IN THE NORTH SEA.</p>
      <p class="main">One December afternoon in the year 1875, just as night was
        closing in,<br>
        the steam-tug <span class="italic">Liverpool</span>, which had left Harwich
        at six o'clock in the<br>
        morning, was seen steaming into the harbour with flag half-mast high.<br>
        It was quite dark when she reached the quay, but there was light<br>
        enough for the crowd collected to see rows of figures laid in the<br>
        stern of the little steamer, the faces covered with blankets. These<br>
        figures, as it presently was made known, were twelve dead bodies, the<br>
        flotsam of the wreck of the <span class="italic">Deutschland</span>. When
        the tug arrived at the<br>
        wreck she found her much as she had been left when the survivors had<br>
        been brought off the previous day. The two masts and the funnel were<br>
        all standing, the sails bellied out with the wind that blustered across<br>
        the sandbank. The wind was so high and the sea so rough that Captain<br>
        Corrington could not bring his tug alongside; but a boat was launched,<br>
        under the charge of the chief mate and Captain Brickerstein, of the<br>
        <span class="italic">Deutschland</span>. The chief officer and the engineer,
        with some sailors<br>
        from the tug, rowed out and made fast to the wreck. It was low water,<br>
        and the deck was dry. There were no bodies lying about the deck or near<br>
        the ship; but on going below, in the saloon cabin there were found<br>
        floating about eight women, a man, and two children. These were taken<br>
        on board the boat, and further search in the fore-cabin led to the<br>
        discovery of the dead body of a man, making twelve in all. One of the<br>
        bodies was that of a lady who, when the wreck was first boarded, had<br>
        been seen lying in her berth. She had since been washed out, and had<br>
        she floated out by the companion-way or through the skylight might<br>
        have drifted out to sea with others. Like all the bodies found, she<br>
        was fully dressed. Indeed, as fuller information showed, there was an<br>
        interval between the striking of the ship and her becoming water-logged<br>
        sufficiently long to enable all to prepare for what might follow.</p>
      <p class="main">According to the captain's narrative, the ill-fated vessel
        steamed out<br>
        of Bremenhaven on Sunday morning with a strong east wind blowing and<br>
        snow falling thickly. This continued throughout Sunday. All Sunday night<br>
        the lead was thrown every half-hour, the last record showing seventeen<br>
        fathoms of water. At four o'clock on Monday morning a light was seen,<br>
        which the captain believed to be that of the <span class="italic">North
        Hinderfire</span> ship, a<br>
        supposition which tallied with the reckoning. The vessel was forging<br>
        slowly ahead, when, at half-past five, a slight shock was felt. This<br>
        was immediately succeeded by others, and the captain knew he had run<br>
        on a bank. The order was passed to back the engines. This was<br>
        immediately done, but before any way could be made the screw broke<br>
        and the ship lay at the mercy of wind and waves. She was bumping<br>
        heavily, and it was thought if sail were set she might be carried<br>
        over the bank. This was tried, but without effect. The captain then<br>
        ordered rockets to be sent up and a gun fired.</p>
      <p class="main">In the meantime the boats were ordered to be swung out,
        but the sea was<br>
        running so high that it was felt it would be madness to launch them. Two<br>
        boats were, however, lowered without orders, one being immediately<br>
        swamped, and six people who had got into her swept into the sea.<br>
        Life-preservers were served out to each passenger. The women were<br>
        ordered to keep below in the saloon, and the men marshalled on deck to<br>
        take turns at the pumps. At night, when the tide rose, the women were<br>
        brought up out of the cabin; some placed in the wheel-house, some on the<br>
        bridge, and some on the rigging, where they remained till they were<br>
        taken off by the tug that first came to the rescue of the hopeless folk.<br>
        The whole of the mail was saved, the purser bringing it into the cabin,<br>
        whence it was fished out and taken on board the tug.</p>
      <p class="main">The passengers were all in bed when the ship struck, and
        were roused<br>
        first by the bumping of the hull, and next by the cry that rang fore and<br>
        aft for every man and woman to put on life-belts, of which there was a<br>
        plentiful store in hand. The women jumped up and swarmed in the<br>
        companion-way of the saloon, making for the deck, where they were met
        by<br>
        the stewardess, who stood in the way, and half forced, half persuaded<br>
        them to go back, telling them there was no danger. After the screw had<br>
        broken, the engines also failed, and the sails proved useless.</p>
      <p class="main">The male passengers then cheerfully formed themselves into
        gangs and<br>
        worked at the pumps, but, as one said, they &quot;were pumping at the
        North<br>
        Sea,&quot; and as it was obviously impossible to make a clearance of that,<br>
        the task was abandoned, and officers, crew, and passengers relapsed into<br>
        a state of passive expectancy of succour from without. That this could<br>
        not long be coming happily seemed certain. The rockets which had been<br>
        sent up had been answered from the shore. The lightship which had helped<br>
        to mislead the captain was plainly visible, and at least two ships<br>
        sailed by so near that till they began hopelessly to fade away, one to<br>
        the northward and the other to the southward, the passengers were sure<br>
        those on board had seen the wreck, and were coming to their assistance.</p>
      <p class="main">Perhaps it was this certainty of the nearness of succour
        that kept off<br>
        either the shrieking or the stupor of despair. However that be, it is<br>
        one of the most notable features about this fearful scene that, with a<br>
        few exceptions, after the first shock everybody was throughout the first<br>
        day wonderfully cool, patient, and self-possessed. There was no regular<br>
        meal on Monday, but there was plenty to eat and drink, and the<br>
        opportunity seems to have been generally, though moderately, improved.<br>
        The women kept below all day, and, while the fires were going, were<br>
        served with hot soup, meat, bread, and wine, and seemed to have been<br>
        inclined to make the best of a bad job.</p>
      <p class="main">Towards night the horror of the situation increased in a
        measure far<br>
        beyond that marked by the darkness. All day long the sea had been<br>
        washing over the ship, but by taking refuge in the berths and on the<br>
        tables and benches in the saloon it had been possible to keep<br>
        comparatively dry. As night fell the tide rose, and at midnight the<br>
        water came rushing over the deck in huge volumes, filling the saloon,<br>
        and making the cabins floating coffins. The women were ordered up and<br>
        instructed to take to the rigging, but many of them, cowed by the<br>
        wildness of the sea that now swept the deck fore and aft, and shuddering<br>
        before the fury of the pitiless, sleet-laden gale, refused to leave the<br>
        saloon.</p>
      <p class="main">Then happened horrible scenes which the pen refuses to portray
        in their<br>
        fulness. One woman, driven mad with fear and despair, deliberately hung<br>
        herself from the roof of the saloon. A man, taking out his penknife, dug<br>
        it into his wrist and worked it about as long as he had strength, dying<br>
        where he fell. Another, incoherently calling on the wife and child he<br>
        had left in Germany, rushed about with a bottle in his hand frantically<br>
        shouting for paper and pencil. Somebody gave him both, and, scribbling
        a<br>
        note, he corked it down in a bottle and threw it overboard, following
        it<br>
        himself a moment later as a great wave came and swept him out of sight.</p>
      <p class="main">There were five nuns on board who, by their terror-stricken
        conduct,<br>
        seem to have added greatly to the weirdness of the scene. They were deaf<br>
        to all entreaties to leave the saloon, and when, almost by main force,<br>
        the stewardess (whose conduct throughout was plucky) managed to get them<br>
        on to the companion-ladder, they sank down on the steps and stubbornly<br>
        refused to go another step. They seemed to have returned to the saloon<br>
        again shortly, for somewhere in the dead of the night, when the greater<br>
        part of the crew and passengers were in the rigging, one was seen with<br>
        her body half through the skylight, crying aloud in a voice heard above<br>
        the storm, &quot;Oh, my God, make it quick! make it quick!&quot; At daylight,
        when<br>
        the tide had ebbed, leaving the deck clear, some one from the rigging<br>
        went down, and, looking into the cabin, saw the nuns floating about face<br>
        upwards, all dead.</p>
      <p class="main">There seems to have been a wonderful amount of unselfishness
        displayed,<br>
        everybody cheering and trying to help every other body. One of the<br>
        passengers--a cheery Teuton, named Adolph Herrmann--took a young<br>
        American lady under his special charge. He helped her up the rigging<br>
        and held her on there all through the night, and says she was as<br>
        brave and as self-possessed as if they had been comfortably on shore.<br>
        Some time during the night an unknown friend passed down to him a<br>
        bottle of whisky. The cork was in the bottle, and as he was holding<br>
        on to the rigging with one hand and had the other round the lady,<br>
        there was some difficulty in getting at the contents of the bottle.<br>
        This he finally solved by knocking the neck off, and then found<br>
        himself in the dilemma of not being able to get the bottle to the<br>
        lady's mouth.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;You are pouring it down my neck,&quot; was her quiet
        response to his first<br>
        essay. In the end he succeeded in aiming the whisky in the right<br>
        direction, and after taking some himself, passed it on, feeling much<br>
        refreshed.</p>
      <p class="main">Just before a terrible accident occurred, which threatened
        death to<br>
        one or both. The purser, who had fixed himself in the rigging some<br>
        yards above them, getting numbed, loosed his hold, and falling headlong<br>
        struck against the lady and bounded off into the sea. But Herrmann kept<br>
        his hold, and the shock was scarcely noticed. On such a night all the<br>
        obligations were not, as Herrmann gratefully acknowledges, on the one<br>
        side; for when one of his feet got numbed, his companion, following his<br>
        direction, stamped on it till circulation was restored.</p>
      <p class="main">From their perilous post, with waves occasionally dashing
        up and<br>
        blinding them with spray, they saw some terrible scenes below. A man<br>
        tied to the mast nearer the deck had his head cut off by the waves,<br>
        as Herrmann says, though probably a rope or a loose spar was the agent.<br>
        Not far off, a little boy had his leg broken in the same manner. They<br>
        could hear and see one of the nuns shrieking through the skylight, and<br>
        when she was silenced the cry was taken up by a woman wailing from<br>
        the wheelhouse,--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;My child is drowned, my little one, Adam!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">At daylight a sailor, running nimbly down the rigging, reached
        the poop,<br>
        and, bending over, attempted to seize some of the half-drowned people<br>
        who were floating about. Once he caught a little child by the clothes;<br>
        but before he could secure it a wave carried it out of his grasp, and<br>
        its shrieks were hushed in the roar of the waters. At nine o'clock, on<br>
        the second morning of the wreck the tide had so far ebbed that the deck<br>
        was clear, and, coming down from the rigging, the battered and shivering<br>
        survivors began to think of getting breakfast. A provident sailor had,<br>
        whilst it was possible, taken up aloft a couple of loaves of black<br>
        bread, a ham, and some cheese. These were now brought out and fairly<br>
        distributed.</p>
      <p class="main">An hour and a half later all peril was over, and the gallant
        survivors<br>
        were steaming for Harwich in the tug-boat <span class="italic">Liverpool</span>.</p>
      <p class="main"><br>
        <span class="boldleft"><a name="152"></a>CHAPTER XV.</span></p>
      <p class="boldleft">A PEEP AT AN OLD HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE LADIES' GALLERY.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;No,&quot; Mrs. Chiltern-Hundreds said when I asked,
        Was she in these days<br>
        a constant visitor at the House of Commons? &quot;Chiltern, you know,
        has<br>
        accepted a place of profit under the Crown, and is no longer eligible<br>
        to sit as a member. It is such trouble to get in, and when you are<br>
        there the chances are that nothing is going on, so I have given it up.<br>
        I remember very well the first time I was there. I wrote all about it<br>
        to an old schoolfellow. If you are interested in the subject, I will<br>
        show you a copy of what I then jotted down.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">I was much interested, and when I saw the letter was glad
        I had<br>
        expressed my interest. The copy placed at my disposal was undated,<br>
        but internal evidence showed that Mrs. Chiltern-Hundreds had paid her<br>
        visit in the session of 1874, when Mr. Disraeli had for the first time<br>
        in his history been returned to power as well as to office, and Mr.<br>
        Gladstone, crushed by an overwhelming defeat, had written his famous<br>
        letter to &quot;My dear Granville,&quot; announcing his retirement from<br>
        political life. Looking down through the grille, the visitor in the<br>
        gallery saw many bearers of well-known names who have travelled far<br>
        since that date, some beyond the grave. Here are Madame's notes<br>
        written in her own angular handwriting:--</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Be in the great hall at four o'clock.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Those were Chiltern's words to me as he hurried off after
        luncheon,<br>
        and here we were in the great hall, but there was no Chiltern,<br>
        which was vexatious. True, it was half-past four, and he is such a<br>
        stickler for what he calls punctuality, and has no sympathy with<br>
        those delays which are inseparable from going out in a new bonnet.<br>
        One of the strings----but there, what does it matter? Here we were<br>
        standing in the great hall, where we had been told to come, and no<br>
        one to meet us. There was a crowd of persons standing before the<br>
        entrance to a corridor to the left of the hall. Two policemen were<br>
        continually begging them to stand back and not block up the entrance,<br>
        so that the members who were passing in and out (I dare say on the<br>
        look-out for their wives, so that they should not be kept here a<br>
        moment) might not be inconvenienced. It is really wonderful how<br>
        careful the police about Westminster are of the sacred persons of<br>
        members. If I cross the road at the bottom of Parliament Street by<br>
        myself I may be run over by a hansom cab or even an omnibus, without<br>
        the slightest compunction on the part of the police on duty there.<br>
        But if Chiltern happens to be with me the whole of the traffic going<br>
        east and west is stopped, and a policeman with outstretched hands<br>
        stands waiting till we have gained the other side of the road.</p>
      <p class="main">We were gazing up with the crowd at somebody who was lighting
        the<br>
        big chandelier by swinging down from somewhere in the roof a sort<br>
        of censer, when Chiltern came out of the corridor and positively<br>
        began to scold us for being late. I thought that at the time very<br>
        mean, as I was just going to scold him; but he knows the advantage<br>
        of getting the first word. He says, Why were we half an hour late?<br>
        and how could he meet us there at four if at that time we had not<br>
        left home? But that's nonsense. Chiltern has naturally a great<br>
        flow of words, which he has cultivated by close attendance upon<br>
        his Parliamentary duties. But he is mistaken if he thinks I am a<br>
        Resolution and am to be moved by being &quot;spoken to.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">We walked through a gallery into a hall something like that
        in which<br>
        Chiltern had kept us waiting, only much smaller. This was full of men<br>
        chattering away in a manner of which an equal number of women would<br>
        have been ashamed. There was one nice pleasant-looking gentleman<br>
        carefully wrapped up in an overcoat with a fur collar and cuffs.<br>
        That was Earl Granville, Chiltern said. I was glad to see his<br>
        lordship looking so well and taking such care of himself. There<br>
        was another peer there, a little man with a beaked nose, the only<br>
        thing about him that reminded you of the Duke of Wellington. He had<br>
        no overcoat, being evidently too young to need or care for such<br>
        encumbrance. He wore a short surtout and a smart blue necktie, and<br>
        frisked about the hall in quite a lively way. Chiltern said that he<br>
        was Lord Hampton, with whom my great-grandfather went to Eton. He<br>
        was at that time plain &quot;John Russell&quot; (not Lord John of course),<br>
        and has for the last forty-five years been known as Sir John<br>
        Pakington. But then Chiltern has a way of saying funny things, and<br>
        I am not sure that he was in earnest in telling us that this active<br>
        young man was really the veteran of Droitwich.</p>
      <p class="main">From this hall, through a long carpeted passage, catching
        glimpses<br>
        on the way of snug writing rooms, cosy libraries, and other devices<br>
        for lightening senatorial labours, we arrived at a door over which<br>
        was painted the legend &quot;To the Ladies' Gallery.&quot; This opened
        on to a<br>
        flight of steps at the top of which was another long corridor, and<br>
        we found ourselves at last at the door of the Ladies' Gallery, where<br>
        we were received by a smiling and obliging attendant.</p>
      <p class="main">I expected to find a fine open gallery something like the
        orchestra<br>
        at the Albert Hall, or at least like the dress circle at Drury Lane.<br>
        Picture my disappointment when out of the bright light of the<br>
        corridor we stepped into a sort of cage, with no light save what<br>
        came through the trellis-work in front. I thought this was one of<br>
        Chiltern's stupid practical jokes, and being a little cross through<br>
        his having kept us waiting for such an unconscionable long time, was<br>
        saying something to him when the smiling and obliging attendant said,<br>
        &quot;Hush-sh-sh!&quot; and pointed to a placard on which was printed,
        like a<br>
        spelling lesson, the impertinent injunction &quot;Silence is requested.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">There was no doubt about it. This was the Ladies' Gallery
        of the British<br>
        House of Commons, and a pretty place it is to which to invite ladies.
        I<br>
        never was good at geometry and that sort of thing, and cannot say how<br>
        many feet or how many furlongs the gallery is in length, but I counted<br>
        fourteen chairs placed pretty close together, and covered with a hideous<br>
        green damask. There are three rows of chairs, the two back rows being<br>
        raised above the first the height of one step. As far as seeing into the<br>
        House is concerned, one might as well sit down on the flight of steps
        in<br>
        Westminster Hall as sit on a chair in the back row in the Ladies'<br>
        Gallery. On the second row it is tolerable enough, or at least you get
        a<br>
        good view of the little old gentleman with the sword by his side sitting<br>
        in a chair at the far end of the House. I thought at first this was the<br>
        Speaker, and wondered why gentlemen on the cross benches should turn<br>
        their backs to him. But Chiltern said it was Lord Charles Russell,<br>
        Sergeant-at-Arms, a much more important personage than the Speaker, who<br>
        takes the Mace home with him every night, and is responsible for its due<br>
        appearance on the table when the Speaker takes the chair.</p>
      <p class="main">In the front row you can see well enough--what there is
        to be seen, for<br>
        I confess that my notion of the majesty of the House of Commons is<br>
        mightily modified since I beheld it with my own eyes. In the first place<br>
        you are quite shut out of sight in the Ladies' Gallery, and I might have<br>
        saved myself all the trouble of dressing, which made me a little late<br>
        and gave Chiltern an opportunity of saying disagreeable things which he<br>
        subsequently spread over a fortnight. I might have been wearing a<br>
        coal-scuttle bonnet or a mushroom hat for all it mattered in a prison<br>
        like this. There was sufficient light for me to see with satisfaction<br>
        that other people had given themselves at least an equal amount of<br>
        trouble. Two had arrived in charming evening dress, with the loveliest<br>
        flowers in their hair. I dare say they were going out to dinner, and at<br>
        least I hope so, for it is a disgraceful thing that women should be<br>
        entrapped into spending their precious time dressing for a few hours'<br>
        stay in a swept and garnished coal-hole like this.</p>
      <p class="main">The smiling and obliging attendant offered me the consolation
        of knowing<br>
        that the Gallery is quite a charming place compared with what it used
        to<br>
        be. Thirty or forty years ago, whilst the business of Parliament was<br>
        carried on in a temporary building, accommodation for ladies was<br>
        provided in a narrow box stationed above the Strangers' Gallery, whence<br>
        they peered into the House through pigeon holes something like what you<br>
        see in the framework of a peep-show. The present Gallery formed part of<br>
        the design of the new Houses, but when it was opened it was a vastly<br>
        different place. It was much darker, had no ante-rooms worth speaking<br>
        of, and the leading idea of a sheep-pen was preserved to the extent of<br>
        dividing it into three boxes, each accommodating seven ladies. About<br>
        twelve years ago one of the dividing walls was knocked down, and the<br>
        Ladies' Gallery thrown into a single chamber, with a special pen to<br>
        which admission is obtained only by order from the Speaker. Still much<br>
        remained to be done to make it even such a place as it now is, and that<br>
        work was done by that much--and, as Chiltern will always have it,<br>
        <span class="italic">unjustly</span>--abused man, Mr. Ayrton. It was he
        who threw open the back of<br>
        the Gallery, giving us some light and air, and it is to him that we<br>
        ladies are indebted for the dressing-room and the tea-room.</p>
      <p class="main">This being shut up is one reason why I was disappointed
        with the House<br>
        of Commons. Another is with respect to the size of the chamber itself.<br>
        It is wonderful to think how <span class="italic">big</span> men can talk
        in a room like this. It<br>
        is scarcely larger than a good-sized drawing-room. I must say for<br>
        Chiltern that we got seats in the front row, and what there was to be<br>
        seen we saw. Right opposite to us was a gallery with rows of men sitting<br>
        six deep. It was &quot;a big night,&quot; and there was not a seat to
        spare in<br>
        this, which I suppose was the Strangers' Gallery. Everybody there had<br>
        his hat off, and there was an official sitting on a raised chair in the<br>
        middle of the top row, something like I saw the warders sitting amongst<br>
        prisoners at Millbank one Sunday morning when Chiltern took me to see<br>
        the Claimant repeating the responses to the Litany. The House itself is<br>
        of oblong shape, with rows of benches on either side, cushioned in<br>
        green leather and raised a little above each other. There are four of<br>
        these rows on either side, with a broad passage between covered with<br>
        neat matting.</p>
      <p class="main">Chiltern says the floor is an open framework of iron, and
        that beneath<br>
        is a labyrinth of chambers into which fresh air is pumped and forced in<br>
        a gentle stream into the House, the vitiated atmosphere escaping by the<br>
        roof. But then the same authority, when I asked him what the narrow band<br>
        of red colour that ran along the matting about a pace in front of the<br>
        benches on either side meant, gravely told me that if any member when<br>
        addressing the House stepped out beyond that line, Lord Charles Russell<br>
        would instantly draw his sword, shout his battle-cry, &quot;Who goes Home!&quot;<br>
        and rushing upon the offender bear him off into custody.</p>
      <p class="main">So you see it is difficult to know what to believe, and
        it is a pity<br>
        people will not always say what they mean in plain English.</p>
      <p class="main">Midway down each row of benches is a narrow passage that
        turned out<br>
        to be &quot;the gangway,&quot; of which you read and hear so much. I had
        always<br>
        associated &quot;the gangway&quot; with a plank along which you walked
        to<br>
        somewhere--perhaps on to the Treasury Bench. But it is only a small<br>
        passage like a narrow aisle in a church. There is a good deal of<br>
        significance about this gangway, for anybody who sits below it is<br>
        supposed to be of an independent turn of mind, and not to be capable<br>
        of purchase by Ministers present or prospective. Thus all the Irish<br>
        members sit below the gangway, and so do Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Charles<br>
        Lewis. It is an odd thing, Chiltern observes, that, notwithstanding<br>
        this peculiarity, Ministries are invariably recruited from below the<br>
        gangway. Sir Henry James sat there for many Sessions before he was<br>
        made Solicitor-General, and there was no more prominent figure in<br>
        recent years than that of the gentleman who used to be known as<br>
        &quot;Mr. Vernon Harcourt.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">On the conservative side this peculiarity is less marked
        than on the<br>
        Liberal, though it was below the gangway on the Conservative side<br>
        that on a memorable night more than a quarter of a century ago a<br>
        certain dandified young man, with well-oiled locks and theatrically<br>
        folded arms, stood, and, glaring upon a mocking House, told them that<br>
        the time would come when they <span class="italic">should </span>hear
        him. As a rule, the<br>
        Conservatives make Ministers of men who have borne the heat and<br>
        burden of the day on the back Ministerial benches. With the Liberals<br>
        the pathway of promotion, Chiltern says, opens from below the gangway.<br>
        Mr. Lowe came from there, so did Mr Goschen, Mr. Stansfeld, Mr.<br>
        Childers, Mr. Foster, and even Mr. Gladstone himself. The worst thing<br>
        a Liberal member who wants to become a Cabinet Minister or a Judge<br>
        can do is to sit on the back Ministerial benches, vote as he is bidden,<br>
        and hold his tongue when he is told. He should go and sit below the<br>
        gangway, near Mr Goldsmid or Mr. Trevelyan, and in a candid, ingenuous,<br>
        and truly patriotic manner make himself on every possible occasion as<br>
        disagreeable to the leaders of his party as he can.</p>
      <p class="main">I do not attempt to disguise the expectation I cherish of
        being some day<br>
        wife of the First Lord of the Admiralty, or at least of the President
        of<br>
        the Board of Trade; for there are few men who can, upon occasion, make<br>
        themselves more disagreeable than Chiltern, who through these awkward<br>
        bars I see sitting below the gangway on the left-hand side, and calling<br>
        out &quot;Hear, hear!&quot; to Sir Stafford Northcote, who is saying something<br>
        unpleasant about somebody on the front Opposition benches.</p>
      <p class="main">The front seat by the table on the right-hand side is the
        Treasury<br>
        bench, and the smiling and obliging attendant tells me the names of the<br>
        occupants there and in other parts of the House. The gentleman at the<br>
        end of the seat with the black patch over his eye is Lord Barrington,<br>
        who, oddly enough, sits for the borough of Eye, and fills the useful<br>
        office of Vice-Chamberlain. Next to him is Sir H. Selwin-Ibbetson,<br>
        Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and whom I have<br>
        heard genially described as &quot;one of the prosiest speakers in the<br>
        House.&quot; Next to him, with a paper in his hand and a smirk of supreme<br>
        self-satisfaction on his face, is Mr. Cross, the Home Secretary.</p>
      <p class="main">He sits beside a figure you would notice wherever you saw
        it. The<br>
        legs are crossed, the arms folded, and the head bent down, showing<br>
        from here one of the most remarkable styles of doing the human hair<br>
        that ever I beheld. The hair is combed forward from the crown of the<br>
        head and from partings on either side, and brought on to the forehead,<br>
        where it is apparently pasted together in a looped curl.</p>
      <p class="main">This is Mr. Disraeli, as I know without being told, though
        I see him<br>
        now for the first time. He is wonderfully old-looking, with sunken<br>
        cheeks and furrowed lines about the mouth and eyes. But his lofty<br>
        brow does not seem to have a wrinkle on it, and his hands, when he<br>
        draws them from under his arms and folds them before him, twiddling<br>
        his thumbs the while, are as smooth and white as Coningsby's. He is<br>
        marvellously motionless, sitting almost in the same position these<br>
        two hours. But he is as watchful as he is quiet. I can see his eyes<br>
        taking in all that goes on on the bench at the other side of the<br>
        table, where right hon. gentlemen, full of restless energy, are<br>
        constantly talking to each other, or passing notes across each other,<br>
        or even pulling each other's coat-tails and loudly whispering<br>
        promptings as in turn they rise and address the House.</p>
      <p class="main">I observe that Mr. Disraeli does not wear his hat in the
        House, and<br>
        Chiltern, to whom I mention this when he comes up again, tells me<br>
        that he and some half-dozen others never do. Since Mr Gladstone has<br>
        retired from the cares of office he is sometimes, but very rarely,<br>
        able to endure the weight of his hat on his head while sitting in<br>
        the House; but, formerly, he never wore it in the presence of the<br>
        Speaker. The rule is to wear your hat in the House, and a very odd<br>
        effect it has to see men sitting about in a well-lighted and warm<br>
        chamber with their hats on their heads.</p>
      <p class="main">Chiltern tells me this peculiarity of wearing hats was very
        nearly<br>
        the means of depriving Great Britain and Ireland of the presence in<br>
        Parliament of Mr. John Martin. That distinguished politician, it<br>
        appears, had never, before County Meath sent him to Parliament,<br>
        worn a hat of the hideous shape which fashion entails upon our<br>
        suffering male kindred. It is well known that when he was returned<br>
        he declared that he would never sit at Westminster, the reason<br>
        assigned for this eccentricity being that he recognised no<br>
        Parliament in which the member for County Meath might sit other<br>
        than one meeting of the classic ground of College Green. But<br>
        Chiltern says that was only a poetical flight, the truth lying at<br>
        the bottom of the hat.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Never,&quot; Mr. Martin is reported to have said to
        a Deputation of his<br>
        constituents, &quot;will I stoop to wear a top hat. I never had one on
        my<br>
        head, and the Saxon shall never make me put it there.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">He was as good as his word when he first came to town, and
        was wont to<br>
        appear in a low-crowned beaver hat of uncertain architecture. But after<br>
        he had for some weeks assisted the process of Legislature under the<br>
        shadow of this hat, the Speaker privately and in considerate terms<br>
        conveyed to him a hint that, in the matter of hats at least, it was<br>
        desirable to have uniformity in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p class="main">Mr. Martin, who, in spite of his melodramatic speeches and
        his strong<br>
        personal resemblance to Danny Man in the &quot;Colleen Nawn,&quot; is,
        Chiltern<br>
        says, really one of the gentlest and most docile of men, straightway<br>
        abandoned the nondescript hat and sacrificed his inclinations and<br>
        principles to the extent of buying what he calls &quot;a top hat.&quot;
        But he<br>
        has not taken kindly to it, and never will. It is always getting in his<br>
        way, under his feet or between his knees, and he is apparently driven<br>
        to observe the precaution of constantly holding it in his hands when it<br>
        is not safely disposed on his head. It is always thus held before him,<br>
        a hand firmly grasping the rim on either side, when he is making those<br>
        terrible speeches we read, in which he proves that John Mitchel is an<br>
        unoffending martyr, and that the English, to serve their private ends,<br>
        introduced the famine in Ireland.</p>
      <p class="main">Mr. Cowen, the member for Newcastle, shares Mr Martin's
        prejudices about<br>
        hats, and up to the present time has not abandoned them. As we passed<br>
        through the lobby on our way to the Gallery, Chiltern pointed him out
        to<br>
        me. He was distinguished in the throng by wearing a round hat of soft<br>
        felt, and he has never been seen at Westminster in any other. But at<br>
        least he does not put it on his head in the House; and it is much better<br>
        to sit upon than the tall hats on the top of which excited orators not<br>
        unfrequently find themselves when, hotly concluding their perorations<br>
        and unconscious of having left their hats just behind them, they throw<br>
        themselves back on the bench from which they had erewhile risen to &quot;say<br>
        a few words.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The gentleman on the left of the Premier is said to be Sir
        Stafford<br>
        Northcote, but there is so little of his face to be seen through the<br>
        abundance of whisker and moustache that I do not think any one has a<br>
        right to speak positively on the matter. The smooth-faced man next to<br>
        him is Mr. Gathorne Hardy. The tall, youthful-looking man on his left
        is<br>
        Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, who, I suppose by instructions of the Cabinet,<br>
        generally sits, as he does to-night, next to Mr. Ward Hunt. The Chief<br>
        Secretary for Ireland is slim; not to put too fine a point on it, Mr.<br>
        Ward Hunt is not, and the two manage to seat themselves with some<br>
        approach to comfort. The First Lord of the Admiralty further eases the<br>
        pressure on his colleagues by throwing his left arm over the back of the<br>
        bench, where it hangs like a limb of some monumental tree.</p>
      <p class="main">The carefully devised scheme for the disposition of Mr.
        Ward Hunt on the<br>
        Treasury bench is completed by assigning the place on the other side of<br>
        him to Sir Charles Adderley. The President of the Board of Trade,<br>
        Chiltern says, is understood to have long passed the mental stage at<br>
        which old John Willet had arrived when he was discovered sitting in his<br>
        chair in the dismantled bar of the Maypole after the rioters had visited<br>
        his hostelry. He is apparently unconscious of discomfort when crushed
        up<br>
        or partially sat upon by his elephantine colleague, which is a fortunate<br>
        circumstance.</p>
      <p class="main">The stolid man with the straight back directly facing Mr
        Disraeli on the<br>
        front bench opposite is the Marquis of Hartington. The gentleman with<br>
        uncombed hair and squarely cut garments on the left of the Leader of the<br>
        Opposition is Mr Forster. The big man further to the left, who sits with<br>
        folded arms and wears a smile expressive of his satisfaction with all<br>
        mankind, particularly with Sir William Harcourt, is the<br>
        ex-Solicitor-General. The duck of a man with black hair, nicely oiled<br>
        and sweetly waved, is Sir Henry James. Where have I seen him before? His<br>
        face and figure and attitude seem strangely familiar to me. I have been<br>
        shopping this morning, but I do not think I could have seen behind any<br>
        milliner's or linendraper's counter a person like the hon. and learned<br>
        gentleman the member for Taunton.</p>
      <p class="main">Beyond this doughty knight, and last at this end of the
        bench, is a<br>
        little man in spectacles, and with a preternatural look of wisdom on his<br>
        face. He is the Right Hon. Lyon Playfair, and is said to have, next to<br>
        Mr. Fawcett, the most remarkably retentive memory of any man in the<br>
        House. Chiltern says he always writes his lectures before he delivers<br>
        them to the House, sending the manuscript to the <span class="italic">Times</span>,
        and so accurate<br>
        is his recitation that the editor has only to sprinkle the lecture with<br>
        &quot;Hear, hears!&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; to make the thing complete.</p>
      <p class="main">On the right-hand side of the Marquis of Hartington is Mr.
        Goschen. In<br>
        fact, at the moment I happen to have reached him in my survey he is on<br>
        his feet, asking a question of his &quot;right hon. friend opposite.&quot;
        What a<br>
        curious attitude the man stands in! Apparently the backs of his legs are<br>
        glued to the bench from which he has risen, a device which enables him,<br>
        as he speaks, to lean forward like a human Tower of Pisa. He is putting<br>
        the simplest question in the world to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,<br>
        but if he were a junior clerk asking his employer for the hand of his<br>
        eldest daughter he could not look more sheepish. His hat is held in his<br>
        left hand behind his back possibly with a view to assist in balancing<br>
        him, and to avoid too much strain on the adhesive powers that keep the<br>
        back of his legs firmly attached to the bench. With his right hand he<br>
        is, when not pulling up his collar, feeling himself nervously round the<br>
        waist, as if to make sure that he is there.</p>
      <p class="main">Next to him are Mr. Dodson and Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, and,
        with these<br>
        planted between him and actual or aspirant leaders of the Liberal party,<br>
        sits Mr. Lowe. I cannot see much of his face from here, for he wears his<br>
        hat and at the moment hangs his head. A little later on I both saw and<br>
        heard him speak and a splendid speech he made, going right to the heart<br>
        of the matter, laying it bare. His success as a debater is a marvellous<br>
        triumph of mind over material influences. It would be hard to conceive<br>
        a man having fewer of the outward graces of oratory than Mr Lowe. His<br>
        utterance is hesitating, sometimes even to stuttering, he speaks<br>
        hurriedly, and without emphasis; his manner is nervous and restless, and<br>
        he is so short-sighted that the literary quotations with which his<br>
        speeches abound are marred by painful efforts to read his notes. Yet how<br>
        he rouses the House, moving it to cheers and laughter, and to the rapid<br>
        interchange of volleys of &quot;Hear, hear&quot; from opposite sides of
        the House,<br>
        which Chiltern says is the most exhilarating sound that can reach the<br>
        ear of a speaker in the House of Commons. Mr. Lowe sits down with the<br>
        same abruptness that marked his rising, and rather gets into his hat<br>
        than puts it on, pushing his head so far into its depths that there is<br>
        nothing of him left on view save what extends below the line of his<br>
        white eyebrows.</p>
      <p class="main">To the right of Mr. Lowe I see a figure which, foreshortened
        from my<br>
        point of view, is chiefly distinguishable by a hat and pair of boots.<br>
        Without absolute Quaker fashion about the cut of the hat or garments,<br>
        there is a breadth about the former and a looseness about the latter<br>
        suggestive of Quaker associations. Perhaps if my idea were mercilessly<br>
        analysed it would appear that it has its growth in the knowledge that<br>
        I am looking down on Mr. Bright, and that I know Mr. Bright is of<br>
        Quaker parentage. But I am jotting down my impressions as I receive<br>
        them. Mr. Bright does not address the House to-night, but he has made<br>
        one or two short speeches this Session, and Chiltern, who has heard<br>
        them, speaks quite sorrowfully of the evidence they give of failing<br>
        physical power. The orator who once used to hold the House of Commons<br>
        under his command with as much ease as Apollo held in hand the fiery<br>
        coursers of the chariot of the sun, now stands before it on rare<br>
        occasions with a manner more nervous than that in which some new<br>
        members make their maiden speech. The bell-like tones of his voice are<br>
        heard no more; he hesitates in choosing words, is not sure of the<br>
        sequence of his phrases, and resumes his seat with evident<br>
        gratefulness for the renewed rest.</p>
      <p class="main">Chiltern adds that much of this nervousness is probably
        owing to a<br>
        sensibility of the expectation which his rising arouses in the House,<br>
        and a knowledge that he is not about to make the &quot;great speech&quot;
        looked<br>
        for ever since he returned to his old place. But at best the matchless<br>
        oratory of John Bright is already a tradition in the House of Commons,<br>
        and it is but the ghost of the famous Tribune who now nightly haunts<br>
        the scene of his former glories. Mr Gladstone was sitting next to Mr.<br>
        Bright, in what the always smiling and obliging attendant tells me is<br>
        a favourite attitude with him. His legs were stretched out, his hands<br>
        loosely clasped before him, and his head thrown back, resting on the<br>
        cushion at the back of the seat, so that the soft light from the<br>
        illuminated roof shone full on his upturned face. It is a beautiful<br>
        face, soft as a woman's, very pale and worn, with furrowed lines that<br>
        tell of labour done and sorrow lived through.</p>
      <p class="main">Here again I am conscious of the possibility of my impressions
        being<br>
        moulded by my knowledge of facts; but I fancy I see a great alteration<br>
        since last I looked on Mr. Gladstone's face, now two years ago. It was<br>
        far away from here, in a big wooden building in a North Wales town. He<br>
        was on a platform surrounded by grotesque men in blue gowns and caps,<br>
        which marked high rank in Celtic bardship. At that time he was the<br>
        nominal leader of a great majority that would not follow him, and<br>
        president of a Ministry that thwarted all his steps. His face looked<br>
        much harder then, and his eye glanced restlessly round, taking in<br>
        every movement of the crowd in the pavilion. He seemed to exist in a<br>
        hectic flush of life, and was utterly incapable of taking rest. Now his<br>
        face, though still thin, has filled up. The lines on his brow and under<br>
        his eyes, though too deeply furrowed to be eradicable, have been<br>
        smoothed down, and there is about his face a sense of peace and a<br>
        pleasant look of rest.</p>
      <p class="main">Chiltern says that sometimes when Mr. Gladstone has been
        in the House<br>
        this Session he has, during the progress of a debate, momentarily<br>
        sprung into his old attitude of earnest, eager attention, and there<br>
        have been critical moments when his interposition in debate has<br>
        appeared imminent. But he has conquered the impulse, lain back again<br>
        on the bench, and let the House go its own way. It is very odd,<br>
        Chiltern says, to have him sitting there silent in the midst of so<br>
        much talking. This was specially felt during the debate about those<br>
        Irish Acts with which he had so much to do.</p>
      <p class="main">Chiltern tells me that whilst the debate on the Irish Bill
        was going on<br>
        there came from no one knows where, passed from hand to hand along the<br>
        benches, a scrap of paper on which was written this verse from &quot;In<br>
        Memoriam&quot;:--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;At our old pastimes in the hall<br>
          We gambol'd making vain pretence<br>
          Of gladness, With an awful sense<br>
          Of one mute Shadow watching all.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">Although the gangway has a distinct and important significance
        in<br>
        marking off <span class="italic">nuances </span>of political parties,
        it appears that it does not<br>
        follow as an inevitable sequence that because a man sits behind the<br>
        Ministerial bench he is therefore a Taper or a Tadpole, or that because<br>
        he takes up his quarters below the gangway he is a John Hampden. The<br>
        distinction is more strongly marked on the Liberal side; but even there<br>
        there are some honest men who usually obey the crack of the Whip. On the<br>
        Conservative side the gangway has scarcely any significance, and though<br>
        the Lewisian &quot;Party,&quot; which consists solely of Charles, sits
        there, and<br>
        from time to time reminds the world of its existence by loudly shouting<br>
        in its ear, it may always be depended upon in a real party division to<br>
        swell the Ministerial majority by one vote. The Scotch members, who sit<br>
        chiefly on the Liberal side, spread themselves impartially over seats<br>
        above and below the gangway. The Home Rule members, who also favour the<br>
        Liberal side, sit together in a cluster below the gangway in defiant<br>
        proximity to the Sergeant-at-Arms. They are rather noisy at times, and<br>
        whenever Chiltern comes in late to dinner, or after going back stays<br>
        till all hours in the morning, it is sure to be &quot;those Irish fellows.&quot;<br>
        But I think the House of Commons ought to be much obliged to Ireland for<br>
        its contribution of members, and to resist to the last the principle of<br>
        Home Rule. For it is not, as at present constituted, an assembly that<br>
        can afford to lose any element that has about it a tinge of originality,<br>
        a flash of humour, or an echo of eloquence.</p>
      <p class="main">That, of course, is Chiltern's remark. I only know, for
        my part, that<br>
        the Ladies' Gallery is a murky den, in which you can hear very little,<br>
        not see much, and are yourself not seen at all.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
      <p class="boldleft">SOME PREACHERS I HAVE KNOWN.</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="170"></a>MR. MOODY.</p>
      <p class="main">I heard Mr. Moody preach twice when he paid his first visit
        to this<br>
        country. Borrowing an idea from another profession, he had a series of<br>
        rehearsals before he came to London. It was in the Free Trade Hall,<br>
        Manchester, and service opened at eight o'clock on a frosty morning in<br>
        December. I had to stand during the whole of the service, one of a crowd<br>
        wedged in the passages between the closely-packed benches. Every<br>
        available seat had been occupied shortly after seven, when the doors<br>
        were thrown open. The galleries were thronged, and even the balconies
        at<br>
        the rear of the hall were full to overflowing. The audience were, I<br>
        should say, pretty equally divided in the matter of sex, and were<br>
        apparently of the class of small tradesmen, clerks, and well-to do<br>
        mechanics; that was the general class of the morning congregation. But<br>
        it must not therefore be understood that the upper class in Manchester<br>
        stood aloof from the special services of the American gentlemen. At the<br>
        afternoon meeting, elegantly attired ladies and gentlemen, wearing<br>
        spotless kid gloves and coats of irreproachable cut, struggled for a<br>
        place in the mighty throng that streamed into the hall.</p>
      <p class="main">Punctually at eight o'clock the meeting was opened by one
        of the local<br>
        clergymen, who prayed for a blessing on the day and the work, declaring,<br>
        amid subdued but triumphant cries from portions of the congregation,<br>
        that &quot;the Lord has risen indeed! Now is the stone rolled away from
        the<br>
        sepulchre, and the Kingdom of God is at hand.&quot; Mr. Moody, who sat
        at a<br>
        small desk in front of the platform, advanced and gave out the hymn,<br>
        &quot;Guide us, O Thou Great Jehovah,&quot; the singing of which Mr. Sankey,<br>
        sitting before a small harmonium, led and accompanied, the vast<br>
        congregation joining with great heartiness.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Mr. Sankey will now sing a hymn by himself,&quot;
        said Mr. Moody; whereupon<br>
        there was a movement in the hall, a rustling of dresses, and a general<br>
        settling down to hear something special.</p>
      <p class="main">The movement was so prolonged that Mr. Moody again stood
        up, and begged<br>
        that every one would be &quot;perfectly still whilst Mr. Sankey sang.&quot;
        There<br>
        was another pause, Mr. Sankey waiting with marked punctiliousness till<br>
        the last cougher had got over his difficulty. Presently the profound<br>
        stillness was broken by the harmonium--&quot;melodeon&quot; is, I believe,
        the<br>
        precise name of the instrument--softly sounding a bar of music. Then Mr.<br>
        Sankey suddenly and loudly broke in with the first line of the hymn,<br>
        &quot;What are you going to do, brother?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Mr Sankey has a fairly good voice, which he used in what
        is called &quot;an<br>
        effective&quot; manner, singing certain lines of the hymn <span class="italic">pianissimo</span>,
        and<br>
        giving the recurrent line, &quot;What are you going to do, brother?&quot;
        <span class="italic">forte</span>,<br>
        with a long dwelling on the monosyllable &quot;do.&quot; When he reached
        the<br>
        last verse, he, after a short pause, began to play a tune well known at<br>
        these meetings, into which the congregation struck with a mighty voice<br>
        that served to bring into stronger prominence the artificial character<br>
        of the preceding performance. The words had a martial, inspiriting sound,<br>
        and as the verse rolled forth, filling the great hall with a mighty<br>
        musical noise, one could see the eyes of strong men fill with tears.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Ho, my comrades! see the signal<br>
          Waving in the sky;<br>
          Reinforcements now appearing,<br>
          Victory is nigh!<br>
          'Hold the fort, for I am coming,'<br>
          Jesus signals still;<br>
          Wave the answer back to Heaven,<br>
          'By Thy grace we Will.'&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">The subject of Mr. Moody's address was &quot;Daniel&quot;--whom
        he once,<br>
        referring to the prophet's position under King Darius, dubbed &quot;the<br>
        Bismarck of those times,&quot; and always called &quot;Dan'l.&quot; One
        might converse<br>
        for an hour with Mr. Moody without discovering from his accent that he<br>
        comes from the United States. But it is unmistakable when he preaches,<br>
        and especially in the colloquies supposed to have taken place between<br>
        characters in the Bible and elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="main">He began his discourse without other preface than a half
        apology for<br>
        selecting a subject which, it might be supposed, everybody knew<br>
        everything about. But, for his part, he liked to take out and look upon<br>
        the photographs of old friends when they were far away, and he hoped his<br>
        hearers would not think it waste of time to take another look at the<br>
        picture of Dan'l. One peculiarity about Dan'l was that there was nothing<br>
        against his character to be found all through the Bible. Nowadays, when<br>
        men write biographies, they throw what they call the veil of charity<br>
        over the dark spots in a career. But when God writes a man's life he<br>
        puts it all in. So it happened that there are found very few, even of<br>
        the best men in the Bible, without their times of sin. But Dan'l came
        out<br>
        spotless, and the preacher attributed his exceptionally bright life<br>
        to the power of saying &quot;No.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">After this exordium, Mr. Moody proceeded to tell in his
        own words the<br>
        story of the life of Daniel. Listening to him, it was not difficult to<br>
        comprehend the secret of his power over the masses. Like Bunyan, he<br>
        possesses the great gift of being able to realise things unseen, and to<br>
        describe his vision in familiar language to those whom he addresses. His<br>
        notion of &quot;Babylon, that great city,&quot; would barely stand the
        test of<br>
        historic research. But that there really was in far-off days a great<br>
        city called Babylon, in which men bustled about, ate and drank, schemed<br>
        and plotted, and were finally overruled by the visible hand of God, he<br>
        made as clear to the listening congregation as if he were talking about<br>
        Chicago.</p>
      <p class="main">He filled the lay figures with life, clothed them with garments,
        and<br>
        then made them talk to each other in the English language as it is<br>
        to-day accented in some of the American States.</p>
      <p class="main">On the previous night I had heard him deliver an address
        in one of the<br>
        densely populated districts of Salford. Admission to the chapel in which<br>
        the service was held was exclusively confined to women, and,<br>
        notwithstanding it was Saturday night, there were at least a thousand<br>
        sober-looking and respectably dressed women present. The subject of the<br>
        discussion was Christ's conversation with Nicodemus--whose social<br>
        position Mr. Moody incidentally made familiar to the congregation by<br>
        observing, &quot;if he had lived in these days, he would have been a doctor<br>
        of divinity, Nicodemus, D. D, or perhaps LL D.&quot; His purpose was to
        make<br>
        it clear that men are saved, not by any action of their own, but simply<br>
        by faith. This he illustrated, among other ways, by introducing a<br>
        domestic scene from the life of the children of Israel in the Wilderness<br>
        at the time the brazen serpent was lifted up. The dramatis personae were<br>
        a Young Convert, a Sceptic, and the Sceptic's Mother. The convert, who<br>
        has been bitten by the serpent, and, having followed Moses' injunction,<br>
        is cured, &quot;comes along&quot; and finds the sceptic lying down &quot;badly
        bitten.&quot;<br>
        He entreats him to look upon the brazen serpent which Moses has lifted<br>
        up. But the sceptic has no faith in the alleged cure, and refuses.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Do you think,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm going to be
        saved by looking at a brass<br>
        serpent away off on a pole? No, no.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Wall, I dunno,&quot; says the young convert, &quot;but
        I was saved that way<br>
        myself. Don't you think you'd better try it?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The sceptic refuses, and his mother &quot;comes along,&quot;
        and observes,<br>
        --&quot;Hadn't you better look at it, my boy?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Well, mother, the fact is, if I could understand the
        f'losophy of it I<br>
        would look up right off; but I don't see how a brass serpent away off
        on<br>
        a pole can cure me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">And so he dies in his unbelief.</p>
      <p class="main">It seemed odd to hear this conversation from the Wilderness
        recited,<br>
        word for word, in the American vernacular, and with a local colouring<br>
        that suggested that both the sceptic and the young convert wore<br>
        tail-coats, and that the mother had &quot;come along&quot; in a stuff
        dress. But<br>
        when the preacher turned aside, and in a few words spoke of sons who<br>
        would not hear the counsel of Christian mothers and refused to &quot;look<br>
        up and live,&quot; the silent tears that coursed down many a face in the<br>
        congregation showed that his homely picture had been clear as the<br>
        brazen serpent in the Wilderness to the eyes of faith before which<br>
        it was held up.</p>
      <p class="main">The story of Daniel is one peculiarly susceptible of Mr.
        Moody's usual<br>
        method of treatment, and for three-quarters of an hour he kept the<br>
        congregation at the morning meeting enthralled whilst he told how<br>
        Daniel's simple faith triumphed over the machinations of the unbeliever.<br>
        Mr. Moody's style is unlike that of most religious revivalists. He<br>
        neither shouts nor gesticulates, and mentioned &quot;hell&quot; only once,
        and<br>
        that in connection with the life the drunkard makes for himself. His<br>
        manner is reflected by the congregation in respect of abstention from<br>
        working themselves up into &quot;a state.&quot; This makes all the more
        impressive<br>
        the signs of genuine emotion which follow and accompany the preacher's<br>
        utterance. When he was picturing the scene of Daniel translating the<br>
        king's dream, rapidly reciting Daniel's account of the dream, and<br>
        Nebuchadnezzar's quick and delighted ejaculation, &quot;That's so!&quot;
        &quot;That's<br>
        it!&quot; as he recognised the incidents, I fancied it was not without<br>
        difficulty some of the people, bending forward, listening with<br>
        glistening eye and heightened colour, refrained from clapping their<br>
        hands for glee that the faithful Daniel, the unyielding servant of<br>
        God, had triumphed over tribulation, and had walked out of prison<br>
        to take his place on the right hand of the king.</p>
      <p class="main">There was not much exhortation throughout the discourse,
        not the<br>
        slightest reference to any disputed point of doctrine. It was nothing<br>
        more than a re-telling of the story of Daniel. But whilst<br>
        Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Darius, and even<br>
        the hundred and twenty princes, became for the congregation living and<br>
        moving beings, all the ends of the narrative were, with probably<br>
        unconscious, certainly unbetrayed, art, gathered together to lead up to<br>
        the one lesson--that compromise, where truth and religion are concerned,<br>
        is never worthy of those who profess to believe God's word.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I am sick of the shams of the present day,&quot; said
        Mr. Moody, bringing<br>
        his discourse to a sudden close. &quot;I am tired of the way men parley<br>
        with the world whilst they are holding out their hands to be lifted<br>
        into heaven. If we're gwine to be good Christians and God's people let<br>
        us be so out-and-out.&quot;</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><br>
        <a name="176"></a>&quot;BENDIGO.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Bendigo, the erewhile famous champion of England, I one
        evening found in<br>
        the pulpit at the London Cabman's Mission Hall. After quitting the ring,<br>
        Bendigo took to politics; that is to say, he, for a consideration,<br>
        directed at Parliamentary elections the proceedings of the &quot;lambs&quot;
        in<br>
        his native town of Nottingham. Now he had given up even that<br>
        worldliness, and had taken to preaching. His fame had brought together
        a<br>
        large congregation. The Hall was crowded to overflowing, and the<br>
        proceedings were, as one of the speakers described it, conducted &quot;by<br>
        shifts,&quot; the leaders, including Bendigo, going downstairs to address
        the<br>
        crowd collected in the lower room after having spoken to the<br>
        congregation in the regular meeting hall.</p>
      <p class="main">The service was opened with prayer by Mr. John Dupee, superintendent
        of<br>
        the Mission, after which the congregation vigorously joined in the<br>
        singing of a hymn. A second hymn followed upon the reading of a psalm;<br>
        and Mr. Dupee proceeded to say a few words about &quot;our dear and saved<br>
        brother, Bendigo.&quot; With a frankness that in no wise disconcerted
        the<br>
        veteran prizefighter, Mr. Dupee discussed and described the condition<br>
        in which he had lived up to about two years ago. The speaker was, it<br>
        appeared, a fellow-townsman of Bendigo's, and his recollection of him<br>
        went back for nearly forty years, at which time his state was so bad<br>
        that Mr. Dupee, then a lad, used to walk behind him through the streets<br>
        of Nottingham praying that he might be forgiven. Now he was saved, and,<br>
        quoting the handbill that had advertised the meeting, Mr. Dupee hailed<br>
        him as &quot;a miracle of mercy, the greatest miracle of the nineteenth<br>
        century,&quot; which view the congregation approved by fervent cries of<br>
        &quot;Praise the Lord!&quot; &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Whether Bendigo would stand steadfast in the new course
        he had begun<br>
        to tread was a matter which--Mr. Dupee did not hide it--was freely<br>
        discussed in the circles where the ex-champion was best known. But<br>
        he had now gone straight for two years, and Mr. Dupee believed he<br>
        would keep straight.</p>
      <p class="main">Before introducing Bendigo to the meeting, Mr. Dupee said
        his own<br>
        &quot;brother Jim&quot; would say a few words, his claim upon the attention
        of<br>
        the congregation being enforced by the asseveration that he was &quot;the<br>
        next great miracle of the nineteenth century.&quot; From particulars which<br>
        Mr. Dupee proceeded to give in relation to the early history of his<br>
        brother, it would be difficult to decide whether he or Bendigo had<br>
        the fuller claim to the title of the &quot;wickedest man in Nottingham.&quot;<br>
        A single anecdote told to the discredit of his early life must<br>
        suffice in indication of its general character. He was, it appeared,<br>
        always getting tipsy and arriving home at untimely hours.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;One night,&quot; said the preacher, &quot;he came
        home very late, and was<br>
        kicking up an awful row in the street just before he came in. I<br>
        opened the window, and, looking out, said to him very gently, 'Now<br>
        Jim, do come in without waking mother.' And what d'ye think he said?<br>
        Why, he said nothing, but just up with a brick and heaved it at me.<br>
        That was Jim in the old days,&quot; he continued, turning to his brother<br>
        with an admiring glance. &quot;He always was lively as a sinner, and<br>
        he's just the same now he's on his way to join the saints.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Jim&quot; even at the outset fully justified this
        exordium by suddenly<br>
        approaching the pulpit desk with his hands stretched out, singing the<br>
        &quot;Hallelujah band.&quot; In the course of an address delivered with
        much<br>
        animation and filled with startling phrases, it became clear that<br>
        &quot;Jim&quot; had been the immediate instrument of the conversion of
        Bendigo.<br>
        He added considerably to the stock of information respecting the<br>
        early life of that personage, and told in detail how better things<br>
        began to dawn upon him.</p>
      <p class="main">At the outset of his new career Bendigo's enthusiasm was
        somewhat<br>
        misdirected, as was manifested at an infidel meeting he attended in<br>
        company with his sponsor.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Who's them chaps on the platform?&quot; said Bendigo
        to Jim.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Infidels,&quot; said Jim.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What's that?&quot; queried Bendigo.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Why, fellows as don't believe in God or the devil.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Then come along, and we'll soon clear the platform,&quot;
        said Bendigo,<br>
        beginning to strip.</p>
      <p class="main">Jim's address lasted for nearly half an hour, and when at
        last brought<br>
        to a conclusion he went below to &quot;begin again&quot; with the crowd
        in the<br>
        lower room.</p>
      <p class="main">Mr. Dupee again appeared at the desk and said they would
        sing a verse<br>
        of a hymn, after which Bendigo would address them, and the plate would<br>
        be handed round for a collection to cover the cost of the bills and of<br>
        Bendigo's travelling expenses. The hymn was a well-known one, with, as<br>
        given out by the preacher, an alteration in the second line thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Praise God from whom all blessings
          flow,<br>
          Praise Him for brother Bendigo.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">This sung with mighty volume of sound, Bendigo, who had
        all this time<br>
        been quietly seated on the platform, advanced, and began to speak in a<br>
        simple, unaffected, but wholly unintelligent manner. He was decently<br>
        dressed in a frock-coat, with black velveteen waistcoat buttoned over<br>
        his broad chest. He was still, despite his threescore years, straight<br>
        as a pole; and had a fine healthy looking face, that belied the fearful<br>
        stories told by his friends of his dissipation. Except a certain<br>
        flattening of the bridge of the nose, a slight indentation on the<br>
        forehead between the eyebrows, and the crooked finger on his left hand,<br>
        he bore no traces of many pitched fights of which he is the hero, and<br>
        might in such an assembly have been taken for a mild-mannered family<br>
        coachman.</p>
      <p class="main">His address, though occasionally marked by the grotesque
        touches which<br>
        characterised the remarks of the two preceding speakers, was not without<br>
        touches of pathos.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;I've been a fighting character,&quot; he said, and
        this was a periphrastic<br>
        way of referring to his old occupation in which he evidently took great<br>
        pleasure; &quot;but now I'm a Miracle. What could I do? I was the<br>
        youngest-born of twenty-one children, and the first thing done with me<br>
        was to put me in a workhouse. There I got among fellows who brought me<br>
        out, and I became a fighting character. Thirty years ago I came up to<br>
        London to fight Ben Caunt, and I licked him. I'm sixty-three now, and<br>
        I didn't think I should ever come up to London to fight for King Jesus.<br>
        But here I am, and I wish I could read out of the blessed Book for then<br>
        I could talk to you better. But I never learnt to read, though I'm<br>
        hoping by listening to the conversation around me to pick up a good<br>
        deal of the Bible, and then I'll talk to you better. I'm only two years<br>
        old at present, and know no more than a baby. It's two years ago since<br>
        Jesus came to me and had a bout with me, and I can tell you He licked<br>
        me in the first round. He got me down on my knees the first go, and<br>
        there I found grace. I've got a good many cups and belts which I won<br>
        when I was a fighting character. Them cups and belts will fade, but<br>
        there's a crown being prepared for old Bendigo that'll never fade.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">This and much more to the same purport the veteran said,
        and then Mr.<br>
        Dupee interposed with more &quot;few words,&quot; the plate was sent round,
        and<br>
        the superintendent and Bendigo went downstairs to relieve &quot;brother
        Jim,&quot;<br>
        the echo of whose stentorian voice had occasionally been wafted in at<br>
        the open door whilst Bendigo was relating his experiences.</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="181"></a>&quot;FIDDLER JOSS.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">It was at another Mission Chapel in Little Wild Street,
        Drury Lane, that<br>
        I &quot;sat under&quot; Fiddler Joss. His &quot;dictionary name,&quot;
        as in the course of<br>
        the evening I learned from one of his friends, is Mr. Joseph Poole. The<br>
        small bills which invited all into whose hands they might fall to &quot;come<br>
        and hear Fiddler Joss&quot; added the injunction &quot;Come early to secure
        a<br>
        seat.&quot; The doors were opened at half-past six, and those who obeyed
        the<br>
        injunction found themselves in a somewhat depressing minority. At<br>
        half-past six there were not more than a score of people present, and<br>
        these looked few indeed within the walls of the spacious chapel. It is
        a<br>
        surprise to find so well-built, commodious, it may almost be added<br>
        handsome, a building in such a poor neighbourhood, and bearing so humble<br>
        a designation. It provides comfortable sitting room for twelve hundred<br>
        persons. There is a neat, substantial gallery running round the hall,<br>
        and forming at one end a circular pulpit, evidently designed after the<br>
        fashion of Mr. Spurgeon's at the Tabernacle--a building of which the<br>
        Mission Chapel is in many respects a miniature.</p>
      <p class="main">The congregation began to drop in by degrees, and proved
        to be of a<br>
        character altogether different from what might have been expected in<br>
        such a place on such an occasion. Out of ten people perhaps one belonged<br>
        to the class among which London missionaries are accustomed to labour.<br>
        But while men and women of the &quot;casual&quot; order were almost entirely<br>
        absent, and men of what is called in this connection &quot;the working
        class&quot;<br>
        were few and far between, there entered by hundreds people who looked
        as<br>
        if they were the responsible owners of snug little businesses in the<br>
        provision, stationery, or &quot;general&quot; line. An air of profound<br>
        respectability, combined with the enjoyment of creature comforts,<br>
        prevailed.</p>
      <p class="main">Whilst waiting for seven o'clock, the hour for the service
        to commence,<br>
        a voluntary choir sang hymns, and the rapidly growing congregation<br>
        joined in fitful snatches of harmony. Little hymn-books with green paper<br>
        backs were liberally distributed, and there was no excuse for silence
        on<br>
        the score of unfamiliarity with the hymns selected. At seven o'clock the<br>
        preacher of the evening appeared on the rostrum, accompanied by two<br>
        gentlemen accustomed, it appeared, to take a leading part in conducting<br>
        the service in the chapel. One gave out a hymn, reading it verse by<br>
        verse, and starting the tune with stentorian voice. This concluded, his<br>
        colleague prayed, in a loud voice, and with energetic action. &quot;We
        must<br>
        have souls to-night,&quot; he said, smiting the rail of the pulpit; &quot;we
        must<br>
        have souls--not by ones and twos--and we must have them to-night in this<br>
        place. There is a drunkard in this place. Give us his soul, O God! There<br>
        is a thief in this place; I do not know where he sits, but God knows.
        We<br>
        want to benefit God, and we must have souls to-night, not by twos and<br>
        threes, but in hundreds.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">After this there was another hymn, sung even with increased
        volume of<br>
        sound. Energy was the predominant characteristic of the whole service,<br>
        and it reached its height in the singing of hymns, when the congregation<br>
        found the opportunity of joining their leaders in the devotional<br>
        utterance. There were half a dozen women in the congregation who had<br>
        solved the home difficulty about the baby by bringing it with them to<br>
        chapel. The little ones, catching the enthusiasm of the place, joined<br>
        audibly in all the acts of worship save in the singing. They crowed<br>
        during the prayers, chattered during the reading of the lesson, and<br>
        loudly wept at intervals throughout the sermon. But there was no room<br>
        for their shrill voices in the mighty shout which threatened to rend the<br>
        roof when hymns were sung.</p>
      <p class="main">Fiddler Joss, being impressively introduced by one of the
        gentlemen in<br>
        the pulpit, began without preface to read rapidly from the fifth chapter<br>
        of Romans, a task he accomplished with the assistance of a pair of<br>
        double eyeglasses. He formally appropriated no text, and it would be<br>
        difficult to furnish any connected account of his sermon. Evidently<br>
        accustomed to address open-air audiences, he spoke at the topmost pitch<br>
        of a powerful voice. Without desire to misapply rules of criticism, and<br>
        in furtherance of an honest intention to describe impressions in as<br>
        simple a form as may be, it must be added that the sermon was as far<br>
        above the heads of a mission-chapel congregation as was the pitch of the<br>
        preacher's voice. Its key-note was struck by an anecdote which Joss<br>
        introduced at the outset of his discourse. There was, he said, a<br>
        clergyman walking down Cheapside one day, when he heard a man calling<br>
        out, &quot;Buy a pie.&quot; The clergyman looked at the man, and recognised
        in him<br>
        a member of his church.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;What, John,&quot; he said, &quot;is this what you
        do in the weekdays?&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the man, &quot;I earn an honest living
        by selling pies.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Poor fellow,&quot; said the parson, &quot;how I pity
        you.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Bother your pity; buy a pie,&quot; retorted the man.</p>
      <p class="main">That, according to Fiddler Joss, is the way in which constituted<br>
        authorities in church and chapel matters deal with the poor man in<br>
        London and elsewhere. Mr. Methodist would not speak to Mr. Baptist, Mr.<br>
        Wesleyan would have nothing to do with Mr. Congregationalist, Mr. High<br>
        Church scoffed at Mr. Low Church, Mr. Low Church did not care what<br>
        became of any of the rest, and among them all the poor man was utterly<br>
        neglected.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;How we pity you,&quot; these people said to the poor
        man.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Bother your pity,&quot; the poor man answered; &quot;buy
        a pie.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Beyond this central argument, affirmation, or illustration,
        Fiddler Joss<br>
        did not get far in the course of the thirty-five minutes during which
        he<br>
        addressed the congregation. At this period he suddenly stopped, and<br>
        asked for the sympathy of his friends, explaining that he was subject
        to<br>
        attacks of sickness, one of the legacies of the days of sin, when he was<br>
        &quot;five years drunk and never sober.&quot; After a pause he recommenced,
        and<br>
        continued for some five minutes longer, when he abruptly wound up,<br>
        apparently having got through only one half of his discourse.</p>
      <p class="main">It is only fair to regard the sermon as an incomplete one,
        and to<br>
        believe that the message which &quot;Fiddler Joss&quot; had entered St.
        Giles's to<br>
        speak to the poor and suffering lay in the second and undelivered<br>
        portion.</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="184"></a>DEAN STANLEY.</p>
      <p class="main">On St. Andrew's Day, 1875, I was present at two memorable
        services in<br>
        Westminster Abbey. For many years during Dean Stanley's reign this<br>
        particular day had been set apart for the holding of special services<br>
        on behalf of foreign missions. What made this occasion memorable in the<br>
        annals of the Church was the fact that the evening lecture was delivered<br>
        by Dr. Moffat, a Nonconformist minister who, in the year after the<br>
        Battle of Waterloo, began his career as a missionary to South Africa,<br>
        and finally closed his foreign labours in the year when Sedan was<br>
        fought. As being the first time a Nonconformist minister had officiated<br>
        in Westminster Abbey, the event created wide interest, and lost none of<br>
        its importance by the remarkable sermon preached in the afternoon by<br>
        Dean Stanley.</p>
      <p class="main">The Dean took for his text two verses, one from the Old
        Testament, the<br>
        other from the New. The first was from the 45th Psalm, and ran thus:<br>
        &quot;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make<br>
        princes in all the earth.&quot; The second was the 16th verse of the 10th<br>
        chapter of the Gospel of St. John: &quot;And other sheep I have, which
        are<br>
        not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My<br>
        voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.&quot; Thus the verse<br>
        runs in the ordinary translation, but the Dean preferred the word<br>
        &quot;flock&quot; in place of fold, and used it throughout his discourse.<br>
        Referring to an address recently delivered by Mr. W. E. Forster on<br>
        &quot;Our Colonies,&quot; the Dean observed that the right hon. gentleman
        had set<br>
        himself the task of considering the question, &quot;What were to be the<br>
        future relations of the Mother Country to the Colonies?&quot; The Dean<br>
        proposed to follow the same course, with this difference: that the<br>
        empire of which he had to speak was a spiritual empire, and the question<br>
        he would consider was what ought to be the policy of the Church of<br>
        England towards fellow-Christians separated from it on matters of form.</p>
      <p class="main">There were, he said, three courses open to the Church. There
        was the<br>
        policy of abstention and isolation; there was the policy of<br>
        extermination or absorption; and there was a middle course, avoiding<br>
        abstention and not aiming at absorption, which consisted of holding<br>
        friendly and constant intercourse with Christians of other Churches,<br>
        earnestly and lovingly endeavouring to create as many points of contact<br>
        as were compatible with holding fast the truth. The errors of all<br>
        religions run into each other, just as their truths do. There was, no<br>
        doubt, some exaggeration in the statement of the Roman Catholic<br>
        authority who declared that &quot;there is but one bad religion, and that
        is<br>
        the religion of the man who professes what he does not believe.&quot;
        But<br>
        there was no reason why, because the Church of England had done in times<br>
        past and was still doing grand work, there should be no place for the<br>
        Nonconformists. Church people rejoiced, and Nonconformists might<br>
        rejoice, that the prayers of the Church of England were enshrined in a<br>
        Liturgy radiant with the traditions of a glorious past. But that was no<br>
        reason why there should be no room where good work was being done for<br>
        men who preferred the chances of extemporaneous prayer--a custom of<br>
        Apostolic origin, and perhaps (very daintily this was put) fittest for<br>
        the exigencies of special occasions.</p>
      <p class="main">If some of the extremer Nonconformists, desirous of wrapping<br>
        themselves in the mantle once worn by Churchmen, and possessed by a love<br>
        for uniformity so exaggerated that they would tear down ancient<br>
        institutions and reduce all Churches to the same level, there was no<br>
        reason why Churchmen should return evil for evil and repay contumely<br>
        with scorn. There was a nobler mission for Christians than that of<br>
        seeking to exterminate each other, a higher object than that of<br>
        endeavouring to sow the seeds of vulgar prejudice either against new<br>
        discoveries or ancient institutions.</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="187"></a>DR. MOFFAT.</p>
      <p class="main">Dean Stanley preached his sermon within the chancel, and
        it formed part<br>
        of the customary afternoon service of the Church of England. Dr. Moffat<br>
        delivered his lecture in the nave, its simple preface being the singing<br>
        of the missionary hymn, &quot;From Greenland's icy mountains.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The pioneer of missionary labour in South Africa was at
        this time close<br>
        upon his eightieth year, but he seemed to have thriven upon hard work,<br>
        and showed no signs of physical weakness. His full, rich voice, musical<br>
        with a northern accent, which long residence in South Africa had not<br>
        robbed of a note, filled every corner of the long aisle, and no section<br>
        of the vast congregation was disappointed by reason of not hearing.<br>
        Wearing a plain Geneva robe with the purple hood of his academic degree,<br>
        he stood at the lectern, situated not many paces from the grave where<br>
        his friend and son-in-law, Dr. Livingstone, lies.</p>
      <p class="main">Dean Stanley was one of many clergymen present, and occupied
        a seat just<br>
        in front of the lectern.</p>
      <p class="main">Dr. Moffat began by protesting that he was very nervous,
        because, having<br>
        been accustomed for fifty years or more to speak and teach and preach
        in<br>
        a language altogether different from European, he had contracted a habit<br>
        of thinking in that language, and sometimes found it momentarily<br>
        difficult to find the exact expression of his thoughts in English.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;If I might,&quot; he said, with a touch of dry humour
        that frequently<br>
        lighted up his discourse, &quot;speak to you in the Betchuana tongue I
        could<br>
        get along with ease. However, I will do what I can.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The lecture resolved itself into a quiet, homely, and exceedingly<br>
        interesting chat, chiefly about the Betchuanas, with whom Dr. Moffat<br>
        longest laboured. When he arrived in the country, early in the present<br>
        century, he found the people sunk in the densest ignorance. Unlike most<br>
        heathen tribes, they had no idea of a God, no notion of a hereafter.<br>
        There was not an idol to be found in all their province, and one the<br>
        lecturer's daughter showed to an intelligent leader of the people<br>
        excited his liveliest astonishment. He was, indeed, so hopelessly<br>
        removed from a state of civilisation that he ridiculed the notion of any<br>
        one worshipping a thing made with his own hands.</p>
      <p class="main">Dr. Moffat seems to have been, on the whole, kindly received
        by the<br>
        natives, though they could not make out what he wanted there. A special<br>
        stumbling-block to them was, how it came to pass that when, as sometimes<br>
        happened, he and Mrs Moffat were disrespectfully treated, they did not<br>
        retaliate. This was satisfactorily explained to the popular mind by the<br>
        assertion of a distinguished member of the community that the foreigners<br>
        had run away from their country, and were content to bear any treatment<br>
        rather than return to their own people, who would infallibly kill them.</p>
      <p class="main">The great difficulty met by Dr. and Mrs. Moffat on the threshold
        of<br>
        their mission was their ignorance of the native language. There were no<br>
        interpreters, and there was nothing for it but to grub along, patiently<br>
        picking up words as they went. The Betchuanas were willing to teach them<br>
        as far as they could, occasionally relieving the monotony of the lesson<br>
        by a little joke at the pupils' expense. Once, Dr. Moffat told his<br>
        hearers, a sentence was written down on a piece of paper, and he was<br>
        instructed to take it to an aged lady, who was to give him something he<br>
        was in need of. He found the old lady, who was scarcely handsome, and<br>
        was decidedly wrinkled, and upon presenting the paper &quot;she blushed
        very<br>
        much.&quot; It turned out that the missionary had been the unconscious
        bearer<br>
        of a message asking the old lady to kiss him, &quot;which,&quot; Dr. Moffat
        added,<br>
        with a seriousness that appeared to indicate a sense of the awkwardness<br>
        of the position still present in his mind, &quot;I did not want to do
        at<br>
        all.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">But he mastered the language at last, and then his moral
        mastery over<br>
        the strange people amongst whom he had been thrown commenced. He found
        a<br>
        firm ally in the Queen, who, first attracted by the flavour of the pills<br>
        and other delicacies he was accustomed to administer to her in his<br>
        capacity of physician, became his constant and powerful friend. Under<br>
        her auspices Christianity flourished, and in Betchuana at the present<br>
        time, where once a printed book was regarded as the white man's charm,<br>
        thousands now are able to read and treasure the Bible as formerly they<br>
        treasured the marks which testified to the number of enemies they had<br>
        slain in battle. Peace reigns where once blood ran, and over a vast<br>
        tract of country civilisation is closely following in the footsteps of<br>
        the missionary.</p>
      <p class="main">Dr. Moffat concluded a simple address, followed with intense
        interest by<br>
        the congregation, by an earnest plea for help for foreign missions. &quot;If<br>
        every child of God in Europe and America,&quot; he said, &quot;would give<br>
        something to this mission, the dark cloud which lies over this neglected<br>
        and mysterious continent would soon be lighted, and before many years<br>
        are passed we might behold the blessed sight of all Africa stretching<br>
        forth her hands to God.&quot;</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="190"></a>MR. SPURGEON.</p>
      <p class="main">In a lane leading from the station at Addlestone is a massive
        oak,<br>
        which, if the gossips of the neighbourhood be trustworthy, has seen some<br>
        notable sights. It is said that under its far-reaching branches<br>
        &quot;Wycliffe has preached and Queen Elizabeth dined.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Here one summer evening I first heard Mr. Spurgeon preach.
        The occasion<br>
        was in connection with the building of a new Baptist Chapel, and when
        I<br>
        arrived the foundation stone was being utilised as a receptacle for<br>
        offerings, over which Mr. Spurgeon, sitting on the wall, and shaded from<br>
        the sun by an umbrella reverently held over his head by a disciple,<br>
        jovially presided.</p>
      <p class="main">After tea a pulpit was extemporised, upon the model of the
        one at the<br>
        Tabernacle, by covering an empty provision box with red baize, and<br>
        fastening before it a wooden railing, also with its decent covering of<br>
        baize. A pair of steps, constructed with a considerable amount of<br>
        trouble, were placed in position before the rostrum; but when, a few<br>
        minutes after seven o'clock, the preacher appeared, he scorned their<br>
        assistance, and scrambled on to the box from the level of the field,<br>
        grasping the rail as soon as he was in a position to face the<br>
        congregation, as if he recognised in it a familiar friend, whose<br>
        presence made him feel at home under the novel circumstances that<br>
        surrounded him. There might, when Mr. Spurgeon stood up, have been<br>
        some doubt whether his voice could be heard throughout the vast throng<br>
        gathered in front of the tree. But the first tones of the speaker's<br>
        voice dispelled uncertainty, and the congregation settled quietly down,<br>
        whilst Mr. Spurgeon, with uplifted hands, besought &quot;the Spirit of
        God to<br>
        be with them, even as in their accustomed places of worship.&quot; A hymn
        was<br>
        sung, a portion of the 55th chapter of Isaiah read, another prayer<br>
        offered up, and the preacher commenced his Sermon.</p>
      <p class="main">He took for his text a portion of the 36th verse of the
        9th chapter of<br>
        Matthew--&quot;He was moved with compassion.&quot; At the outset he sketched,
        with<br>
        rapid eloquence, the history of Jesus Christ. The first declaration that<br>
        might have startled one not accustomed to the preacher's style of<br>
        oratory was his expression of a preference for people who absolutely<br>
        hated religion over those who simply regarded it with indifference.<br>
        These former were people who showed they did think, and, like Saul of<br>
        Tarsus, there was hope of their conversion.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;It is,&quot; he said, &quot;a great time when the
        Lord goes into the devil's<br>
        army, and, looking around him, sees some lieutenant, and says to him,<br>
        'Come along; you have served the black master long enough, I have need<br>
        of you now.' It is astonishing how quietly he comes along, and what a<br>
        valiant fight he fights on the side of his new master.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">Mr. Spurgeon had a protest to make against the practice
        of refusing to<br>
        help the poor except through the machinery of the Poor Law. Referring
        to<br>
        Christ's having compassionated the hungry crowd and fed them, he said:<br>
        &quot;If Jesus Christ were alive now and presumed to feed a crowd of people,<br>
        He would be had up by some society or other, and prosecuted for<br>
        encouraging mendicancy. If He were alive in these days He would, I much<br>
        fear, have occasion to say, 'I was hungry, and ye fed Me not; thirsty,<br>
        and ye gave Me no drink; destitute, and you told Me to go on the<br>
        parish.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">He thought tracts were very good things in their way, but
        should not be<br>
        relied upon solely as a means of bringing poor people to the Lord. &quot;I<br>
        believe a loaf of bread often contains the very essence of theology, and<br>
        the Church of God ought to look to it that there are at her gates no,<br>
        poor unfed, no sick untended.&quot; He was rather hard on &quot;the clergy
        of all<br>
        denominations,&quot; regretting to say that &quot;as fish always stunk
        first at<br>
        the head, so a Church when it goes wrong goes bad first among its<br>
        ministers.&quot; He concluded by an eloquent appeal to his hearers to
        lose no<br>
        time in seeking salvation, calling &quot;heaven and earth, and this old
        tree,<br>
        under which the Gospel was preached five hundred years ago, to bear<br>
        witness that I have preached to you the word of God, in which alone<br>
        salvation is to be found.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The sermon occupied exactly an hour in the delivery, and
        was listened to<br>
        throughout with profound attention. When it was over, Mr. Spurgeon held<br>
        a sort of lev&eacute;e from the pulpit, the people pressing round to shake
        his<br>
        hand, and it was nearly nine o'clock before the last of the congregation<br>
        had passed away, leaving Wycliffe's Tree to its accustomed solitude.</p>
      <p class="main">The next time I heard Mr. Spurgeon preach was in his famous
        church. The<br>
        Tabernacle will hold six thousand people when full, and on this night
        it<br>
        was thronged from door to door, and from floor to ceiling, with a<br>
        congregation gathered together to &quot;watch&quot; whilst the Old Year
        died and<br>
        the New was born. At eleven o'clock when Mr. Spurgeon, gownless and<br>
        guiltless of white neck-tie, or other clerical insignia, unceremoniously<br>
        walked on to the platform which serves him for pulpit, there was not a<br>
        foot of vacant space in the vast area looked down upon from the<br>
        galleries, for even the aisles were thronged. The capacious galleries<br>
        that rise tier over tier to the roof were crowded in like manner, and<br>
        the preacher stood, faced and surrounded by a congregation, the sight
        of<br>
        which might well move to the utterance of words that burn a man who had<br>
        within him a fount of thoughts that breathe.</p>
      <p class="main">There was no other prelude to the service than the simply
        spoken<br>
        invitation, &quot;Let us pray,&quot; and the six thousand, declaring themselves<br>
        &quot;creatures of time,&quot; bent the knee with one accord to ask the
        &quot;Lord of<br>
        Eternity&quot; to bless them in the coming year. After this a hymn was
        sung,<br>
        Mr. Spurgeon reading out verse by verse, with occasional commentary, and<br>
        not unfrequent directions to the congregation as to the manner of their<br>
        singing.</p>
      <p class="main">&quot;Dear friends, the devil sometimes makes you lag half
        a note behind the<br>
        leader. Just try if you can't prevail over him to-night, and keep up in<br>
        proper time.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">There is no organ, nor even a tuning-fork, in use at the
        Tabernacle. But<br>
        the difficulties, apparently insuperable under these circumstances, of<br>
        leading so vast a congregation in the singing of unpractised tunes is<br>
        almost overcome by the skilful generalship of the gentleman who steps<br>
        forward to the rails beside the preacher's table, pitches the note,<br>
        and leads the singing. The hymn brought to a conclusion, Mr. Spurgeon<br>
        read and commented upon a passage of Scripture from the 25th of Matthew.<br>
        Then another hymn. &quot;Sing this verse very softly and solemnly,&quot;
        says the<br>
        pastor; and the congregation in hushed tones, that seem to thrill all<br>
        through the aisles and up through the crowded galleries, sing:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Who of us death's awful road<br>
          In the coming year shall tread,<br>
          With Thy rod and staff, O God,<br>
          Comfort Thou his dying bed.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">After another prayer from the pastor, and one from one of
        the deacons<br>
        who accompanied him on the platform and sat behind in the crimson velvet<br>
        arm-chairs, a third hymn was sung, and Mr. Spurgeon began his short<br>
        address.</p>
      <p class="main">He took for text the 42nd verse of the 12th chapter of Exodus:
        &quot;It is a<br>
        night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the<br>
        land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the<br>
        children of Israel in their generations.&quot; The night referred to in
        the<br>
        text was that of the Passover--&quot;a night of salvation, decision,<br>
        emigration, and exultation,&quot; said the preacher, &quot;and I pray
        God that<br>
        this night, the last of a memorable year, may be the same for you, my<br>
        friends. Oh for a grand emigration among you like that of the departure<br>
        of the people of Israel--an emptying out of old Egypt, a robbing of<br>
        Pharaoh of his slaves, and the devil of his dupes!&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">It was understood that Mr. Spurgeon was labouring under
        severe<br>
        indisposition, and probably this fact gave to his brief address a tone<br>
        comparatively quiet and unimpassioned. Only once did he rise to the<br>
        fervent height of oratory to which his congregation are accustomed, and<br>
        that at the close, when, with uplifted hands and louder voice, he<br>
        apostrophised the parting year: &quot;Thou art almost gone, and if thou
        goest<br>
        now the tidings to the throne of God will be that such and such a soul<br>
        is yet unsaved. Oh, stay yet a while, Year, that thou mayest carry with<br>
        thee glad tidings that the soul is saved! Thy life is measured now by<br>
        seconds, but all things are possible with God, and there is still time<br>
        for the salvation of many souls.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">At five minutes to twelve the preacher paused, and bade
        his hearers &quot;get<br>
        away to the Throne of Grace, and in silent prayer beseech the Almighty<br>
        to bless you with a rich and special blessing in the new year He is<br>
        sending you.&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">The congregation bent forward and a great silence was upon
        it, broken<br>
        only by half-stifled coughing here and there, and once by the wailing
        of<br>
        an infant in the gallery. The minutes passed slowly and solemnly as the<br>
        Old Year's &quot;face grew sharp and thin&quot; under the ticking of the
        clock<br>
        over the kneeling preacher and his deacons. The minutes dwindled down
        to<br>
        seconds, and then--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <span class="smallquote">&quot;Alack, our friend is gone!<br>
          Close up his eyes, tie up his chin<br>
          Step from the corpse, and let him in<br>
          That standeth at the door.&quot;</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">&quot;Now, as we have passed into the New Year,&quot; said
        Mr. Spurgeon, advancing<br>
        to the rails as the last stroke of midnight died away, &quot;I do not
        think<br>
        we can do better than join in singing 'Praise God from whom all<br>
        blessings flow.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="main">No need now of instructions how to sing. The congregation
        were almost<br>
        before the leader in raising the familiar strain, with which six<br>
        thousand voices filled the spacious Tabernacle.</p>
      <p class="main">Then came the benediction, and a cheery &quot;I wish you
        all a happy New<br>
        Year, my friends,&quot; from Mr. Spurgeon.</p>
      <p class="main">A great shout of &quot;The same to you!&quot; arose in response
        from basement and<br>
        galleries, and the congregation passed out into a morning so soft, and<br>
        light, and mild, that it seemed as if the seasons were out of joint, and<br>
        that the New Year had been born in the springtime.</p>
      <p class="boldleft"><a name="196"></a>IN THE RAGGED CHURCH.</p>
      <p class="main">The Ragged Church is one of the numerous by-paths through
        which the<br>
        managers of the Field Lane Institution strive to approach and benefit<br>
        the poor of London. It is situate in Little Saffron Hill, Farringdon<br>
        Road, the service being held in a barn-like room, which on weekdays<br>
        serves for school, and is capable of accommodating a thousand children.<br>
        No money has been expended in architectural embellishment, and no<br>
        question of a controversial character is likely to arise in connection<br>
        with accessories in the shape of altar, surplice, or candles. The Ragged<br>
        Church avoids these stumbling-blocks by the simple expedient of doing<br>
        without candles, surplices, or altar. It does not even boast a pulpit,<br>
        but draws the line so as to take in a harmonium, indispensable for<br>
        leading the tunes. At one end of the room is a platform, on which the<br>
        harmonium stands, and whereon the service is conducted.</p>
      <p class="main">It is the congregation rather than the preacher that I remember
        best in<br>
        connection with the Ragged Church. Half-past eleven is the hour for the<br>
        commencement of service, and was fixed upon chiefly to suit the<br>
        convenience of a portion of the congregation, who, having slept<br>
        overnight in the casual wards, are considerately detained in them till<br>
        eleven o'clock, by which time society is supposed to be comfortably<br>
        seated in its own churches, and is thus saved the shock of suddenly<br>
        coming upon Rags and Tatters going to church or elsewhither--Rags and<br>
        Tatters, it being well understood, not always showing themselves proof<br>
        against the temptation of improving the occasion by begging. At a<br>
        quarter to eleven there filed into the church threescore little girls,<br>
        all dressed in wincey dresses, with brown, furry jackets and little<br>
        brown hats, a monotony of colour that served to bring into fuller<br>
        contrast the red and black wool scarf each wore tightly tied round her<br>
        neck. They all looked bright, clean, and happy, and one noted a<br>
        considerable proportion of pretty-faced and delicately-limbed children.</p>
      <p class="main">How they were born, or with what parentage, is in many cases
        a question<br>
        to which the records of the institution supply no answer. They were<br>
        simply &quot;found&quot; on a doorstep, or arrested when wandering about
        the<br>
        street crying for the mother or the father who had cast them off. This<br>
        class of school-girl is generally distinguished by the fineness of her<br>
        Christian name, Blanche, and Lily, and Constance, being among the waifs<br>
        and strays who have found a refuge with the kindly matron of the Field<br>
        Lane Institution. There are others whose history is written plainly<br>
        enough in the records of the police-courts.</p>
      <p class="main">There is one, a prematurely aged little woman in her eleventh
        year, who,<br>
        previous to being sent here, passed of her own free will night after<br>
        night in the streets, living through the day on her wits, which are very<br>
        sharp. Another, about the same age, when taken into custody on something<br>
        more than suspicion of picking pockets, was found the possessor of no<br>
        fewer than seven purses. A third, who is understood to be now in her<br>
        ninth year, earned a handsome livelihood in the Haymarket by frequenting<br>
        the public houses, and with dramatic gestures singing the more popular<br>
        concert-hall songs. One of the most determined and head-strong young<br>
        ladies of the establishment was not privileged to be present at the<br>
        morning service, being, in fact, in bed, where she was detained with the<br>
        hope that amid the silence and solitude of the empty chamber she might<br>
        be brought to see in its true light the heinousness of the offence of<br>
        wilfully depositing her boots in a pail of water.</p>
      <p class="main">Conviction for offences against the law is by no means a
        general<br>
        characteristic of the girls. For the most part, destitution has been the<br>
        simple ground on which they have obtained admission to the institution.</p>
      <p class="main">The girls being seated on the front benches to the right
        of the<br>
        harmonium, the tramp of many feet was heard, and there entered by the<br>
        opposite side of the church some sixty boys in corduroys, short jackets,<br>
        and clean collars. They took up a position on the left of the harmonium,<br>
        and, with one consent, gravely folded their arms. Their private history<br>
        is, in its general features, much the same as that of the girls. All<br>
        are sent hither by order of the police-court magistrate, but<br>
        many have not committed any crime save the unpardonable one of being<br>
        absolutely and hopelessly homeless. It is not difficult, stating the<br>
        broad rule, to pick out from the boys those who have been convicted of<br>
        crime. As compared with the rest they are generally brighter looking,<br>
        and gifted with a stronger physique.</p>
      <p class="main">The distinction was strongly marked by the conjunction of
        two boys who<br>
        sat together on the front form. One who had stolen nothing less than a<br>
        coalscuttle, observed projecting from an ironmonger's shop in Drury<br>
        Lane, was a sturdy, ruddy-cheeked little man, who folded his arms in a<br>
        composed manner, and listened with an inquiring interest to the words<br>
        poured forth over his head from the platform. The boy next to him, a<br>
        pale-faced, inert lad, who stared straight before him with lack-lustre<br>
        eyes, had the saddest of all boys' histories. He was born in a casual<br>
        ward, his father died in a casual ward, and his mother nightly haunts<br>
        the streets of London in pursuance of an elaborately devised plan, by<br>
        which she is able so to time her visits to the various casual wards as<br>
        never to be turned away from any on the ground that she had slept there<br>
        too recently.</p>
      <p class="main">The foreground of the Ragged Church was bright enough, for
        whilst there<br>
        is youth there is hope, and in the present case there is also the<br>
        knowledge that these children are under guardianship at once kind and<br>
        wise. Presently the back benches began to fill with a congregation such<br>
        as no other church in London might show. Crushed-looking women in limp<br>
        bonnets, scanty shawls, and much-patched dresses crept quietly in. With<br>
        them, though not in their company, came men of all ages, and of a<br>
        general level of ragged destitution--a gaunt, haggard, hungry, and<br>
        hopeless congregation as ever went to church on a Sunday morning. Some<br>
        had passed the night in the Refuge attached to the institution; many had<br>
        come straight from the casual wards; others had spent the long hours<br>
        since sundown in the streets; and one, a hale old man who diffused<br>
        around him an air of respectability and comfort, was a lodger at<br>
        Clerkenwell Workhouse. His snuff-coloured coat with two brass buttons
        at<br>
        the back was the solitary whole garment visible in this section of the<br>
        congregation.</p>
      <p class="main">It was his &quot;Sunday out&quot; and having had his breakfast
        at the workhouse,<br>
        he had, by way of distraction, come to spend the morning and eat his<br>
        lunch at the Field Lane Institution.</p>
      <p class="main">One man might be forgiven if he slept all through the sermon,
        for, as he<br>
        explained, he had &quot;passed a very bad night.&quot; He had settled
        himself to<br>
        sleep on various doorsteps, with the fog for a blanket and the railings<br>
        for pillow. But there appeared what in his experience was a quite<br>
        uncommon activity on the part of the police, and he had been &quot;moved
        on&quot;<br>
        from place to place till morning broke, and he had not slept a wink or<br>
        had half an hour's rest for the sole of his foot.</p>
      <p class="main">There were not many of the labouring class among the couple
        of hundred<br>
        men who made up this miserable company. They were chiefly broken-down<br>
        people, who, as tradesmen, clerks, or even professional men, had<br>
        gradually sunk till they came to regard admission to the casual ward at<br>
        night as the cherished hope that kept them up as they shuffled their<br>
        way through the day. One man, who over a marvellous costume of rags<br>
        carried the mark of respectability comprehended in a thin black silk<br>
        necktie tied around a collarless neck, is the son of a late colonel of<br>
        artillery, and has a brother at the present time a lieutenant in one of<br>
        her Majesty's ships. After leading a reckless life, he turned his<br>
        musical acquirements to account by joining the band of a marching<br>
        regiment. Unfortunately, the death of his grandfather, two years ago,<br>
        made him uncontrolled possessor of &pound;500, and now he is dodging his<br>
        way among the casual wards of London, holding on to respectability and<br>
        his good connections by this poor black silk necktie.</p>
      <p class="main">Among the congregation was a bright-eyed, honest-looking
        lad bearing the<br>
        familiar name of John Smith. Three months ago he was earning his living<br>
        in a Yorkshire coal pit, when a strike among the men threw him out of<br>
        work. There being no prospect of doing anything in Yorkshire, he set out<br>
        for London, having, as he said, &quot;heard it was a great place, where
        work<br>
        was plenty.&quot; With three shillings in his pocket he started from Leeds,<br>
        and walked to London, doing the journey in nine days. He had neither<br>
        recommendation nor introduction other than his bright, honest, and<br>
        intelligent face, and that seems to have served him only to the extent<br>
        of getting an odd job that occupied him two days.</p>
      <p class="main">The service opened with singing, of which there was a plentiful<br>
        repetition, the boys and girls in the foreground singing, the melancholy<br>
        throng behind standing dumb. Hymn-books were supplied to them, and if<br>
        they could read they might have found on the page from which the first<br>
        hymn was taken a hymn so curiously infelicitous to the occasion that it<br>
        is worth quoting a couple of verses. These are the two first:--</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="main"> <span class="smallquote">Let us gather up the sunbeams<br>
          Lying all around our path;<br>
          Let us keep the wheat and roses,<br>
          Casting out the thorns and chaff;<br>
          Let us find our sweetest comfort<br>
          In the blessings of to-day<br>
          With a patient hand removing<br>
          All the briars from the way.</span></p>
        <p class="smallquote"> Strange we never prize the music<br>
          Till the sweet-voiced bird has flown,<br>
          Strange that we should slight the violets<br>
          Till the lovely flowers are gone;<br>
          Strange that summer skies and sunshine<br>
          Never seem one half so fair<br>
          As when winter's snowy pinions<br>
          Shake the white down in the air.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="main">After the opening hymns <span class="italic">Sankey's Sacred
        Song-Book</span>, in which this rhymed<br>
        nonsense appears, was abandoned, and the congregation took to the<br>
        admirable little selection of hymns compiled for the use of the<br>
        institution, containing much less sentiment, and perhaps on the whole<br>
        more suitable. After prayer and a short address, the boys and girls<br>
        filed out as they had come in. Then the rest of the congregation rose,<br>
        and as they passed out received a large piece of bread, supplemented by<br>
        the distribution from a room on a lower storey of a cup of hot cocoa.<br>
        Stretching all down the long flight of stone steps, they drank their<br>
        cocoa and greedily munched the bread, and when it was done passed out<br>
        into the sabbath noon, to slouch about the great city till the doors of<br>
        the casual wards were open.</p>
      <p class="main">They had &quot;gathered up all the sunbeams lying around
        their path&quot; as far<br>
        as the day had advanced, and there was no more for them till, at eight<br>
        o'clock in the evening, the bread and tea should be set out before them<br>
        under the workhouse roof.</p>
